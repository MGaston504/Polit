<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>Expresses the sense of the House of Representatives that in order to continue aggressive growth in the nation's telecommunications and technology industries the U.S. government should "Get Out of the Way and Stay Out of the Way" by: (1) promoting investment through deregulation and free-market competition; (2) making additional spectrum available for commercial use through unencumbered auctions, reallocation of federal spectrum, and efficient spectrum sharing; (3) establishing a national goal of transmitting high-quality, real-time voice, data, graphics, and video at increasingly higher speeds to all people in the United States, especially in rural and underserved areas; (4) ensuring individual privacy without compromising market efficiencies; and (5) promoting cyber threat sharing for allowing the private sector to actively defend communications networks.</p>]]></summary-text>
