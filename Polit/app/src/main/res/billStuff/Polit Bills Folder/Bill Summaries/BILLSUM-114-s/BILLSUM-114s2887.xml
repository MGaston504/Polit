<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Missile Defense Defend and Deter Act of 2016</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Defense (DOD) Missile Defense Agency to administer an intercept flight test of the ground-based midcourse defense element of the ballistic missile defense system at least once each fiscal year. </p> <p>Each test shall provide for: </p> <ul> <li>validation of the defense element's operational effectiveness;</li> <li>use of assets in their operational configuration against an inventory of targets to assess performance in a variety of flight test regimes; </li> <li>use of operational doctrine and real-world constraints; </li> <li>evaluation of new concepts of operations, tactics, and techniques; and </li> <li>mechanisms to assure the confidence of members of the Armed Forces in the basic design of the ground-based midcourse defense element, its hit-to-kill effectiveness, and its operational capability. </li> </ul> <p>The Agency may forgo a test if: </p> <ul> <li>it would jeopardize national security, not be successful due to specific ground-based midcourse defense components needing a non-intercept test, and likely fail due to impractical time considerations; or </li> <li>funding is insufficient.</li> </ul> <p>The Agency also may forgo a test if DOD determines that the testing is detrimental to U.S. national security interests and provides notice to Congress.</p>]]></summary-text>
