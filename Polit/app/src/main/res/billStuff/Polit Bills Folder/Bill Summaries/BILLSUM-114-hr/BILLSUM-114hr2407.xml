<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>School Milk Nutrition Act of 2015 </b></p> <p>This bill revises the requirements for milk provided by the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) and other Department of Agriculture (USDA) programs. </p> <p>The bill amends the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act to require the milk offered to students participating in the NSLP to include low-fat flavored milk containing no more than 150 calories per 8-ounce serving. </p> <p>For students who cannot consume fluid milk because of a medical or other dietary need, schools may offer a nondairy beverage that is nutritionally equivalent to low-fat milk and meets USDA nutritional standards, including fortification of calcium, protein, vitamin A, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, riboflavin, and vitamin B-12. (Under current law, the substitute is only required to include fortification of calcium, protein, vitamin A, and vitamin D to levels found in cow's milk.) </p> <p>In establishing national school nutritional standards, USDA must provide that containers of all beverages sold in schools have the same maximum volume. </p> <p>USDA must also: (1) study and report to Congress on recent trends in fluid milk consumption in schools; (2) carry out a pilot program to test and demonstrate strategies by which schools can increase the consumption of fluid milk; (3) make lactose-free milk with an extended shelf life available to schools; and (4) allow women participating in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) to receive reduced fat milk for themselves and their children upon request.</p>]]></summary-text>
