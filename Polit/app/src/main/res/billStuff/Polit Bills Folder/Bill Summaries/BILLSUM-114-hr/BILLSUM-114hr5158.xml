<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Make America Competitive Act of 2016</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow corporations to elect a 10% tax rate on their taxable income if such corporations: (1) offer their full-time employees group health insurance coverage, (2) offer such employees a defined contribution pension plan, (3) provide their employees with regular pay increases, and (4) make additional social security contributions for employees who do not have a defined benefit pension plan. Such corporations may also elect to repatriate their current and accumulated foreign earnings at a 5% tax rate. </p> <p>The bill amends title II (Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act to increase the primary insurance amount (the retirement benefit a social security recipient would receive if benefits are taken at normal retirement age) of employees for whom additional social security contributions are made under this bill. </p>]]></summary-text>
