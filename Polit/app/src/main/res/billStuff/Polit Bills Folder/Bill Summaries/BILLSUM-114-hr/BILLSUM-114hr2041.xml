<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Public Power Risk Management Act of 2015</b></p> <p> Amends the Commodity Exchange Act to direct the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), when it determines whether to provide an exemption to designation as a swap dealer, to treat a utility operations-related swap entered into with a utility special entity as if such swap were entered into with an entity that is not a special entity. (Thus exempts an entity entering into a utility operations-related swap with a utility special entity from mandatory registration as a swap dealer.)</p> <p>Requires transactions in utility operations-related swaps to be reported according to requirements for the reporting of uncleared swaps.</p> <p>Defines &quot;utility special entity&quot; as a special entity, or any instrumentality, department, or corporation of or established by a state or local government, that: (1) owns or operates, or anticipates owning or operating, an electric or natural gas facility or an electric or natural gas operation; (2) supplies or anticipates supplying natural gas or electric energy to another utility special entity; (3) has or anticipates having public service obligations under federal, state, or local law or regulation to deliver electric energy or natural gas service to customers; or (4) is a federal power marketing agency.</p> <p>Redefines swap to include a utility operations-related swap.</p> <p>Defines &quot;utility operations-related swap&quot; as one that: (1) is entered into to hedge or mitigate commercial risk; (2) is associated with specified transactions in electric energy or natural gas; and (3) is not a contract, agreement, or transaction based on, derived on, or referencing:</p> <ul> <li>an interest rate, credit, equity, or currency asset class; </li> <li>a metal, agricultural commodity, or crude oil or gasoline commodity of any grade, except as used as fuel for electric energy generation; and </li> <li>any other commodity or category of commodities identified for this purpose in a CFTC rule or order adopted in consultation with federal and state regulatory commissions.</li> </ul>]]></summary-text>
