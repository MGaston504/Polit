<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Small Public Housing Agency Opportunity Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to subject a small public housing agency (PHA) to the same requirements as a PHA.</p> <p>A small PHA is a PHA for which the sum of the number of public housing dwelling units and the number of vouchers under Section 8 (tenant-based assistance) it administers is 550 or fewer.</p> <p>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) shall:</p> <ul> <li>carry out physical inspections of a small PHA public housing project at least once every three years, unless it is a troubled small PHA;</li> <li>determine the financial condition of a small PHA public housing program solely on the basis of the ratio of current assets to current liabilities; and </li> <li>determine management condition of a small PHA public housing program solely on the basis of the ratio of vacant unit months to eligible unit months.</li> </ul> <p>A small PHA administering Section 8 tenant-based assistance under the housing voucher program must make physical inspections of assisted units at least once every three years.</p> <p>HUD shall evaluate the management of a small PHA's voucher program solely on the basis of its lease-up rate or the budget utilization rate, which must be at least 90% to be acceptable.</p> <p>HUD shall designate a small PHA as a high-performing agency if it exceeds acceptability criteria.</p> <p>HUD may designate a small PHA as a troubled small PHA with respect to its public housing program or housing voucher program only if it meets certain negative criteria.</p> <p>HUD shall establish an appeals process for a small PHA to dispute a determination of deficiency.</p> <p>HUD and a troubled small PHA shall enter into a one-year corrective action agreement (renewable at HUD option) under which the small PHA must undertake actions to correct deficiencies.</p> <p>The bill prescribes and/or revises requirements to reduce the administrative burden on small PHAs with respect to:</p> <ul> <li>certain reports;</li> <li>community service;</li> <li>economic opportunities for low- and very low-income persons;</li> <li>exemption of a small PHA administering not more than 400 public housing dwelling units, upon request, from any asset management requirement;</li> <li>exemption from environmental review for a development or modernization project involving new construction if the new construction portion of the total cost does not exceed $100,000; and </li> <li>streamlined HUD procedures for such reviews. </li> </ul> <p>Small PHAs shall also be exempt from Green Physical Needs Assessment requirements for any fiscal year for which a specified circumstance occurs.</p> <p>HUD shall carry out a demonstration project to examine how various methods of determining rent in public housing affect the administrative burden on small PHAs and public housing residents.</p> <p>The bill establishes rent-setting mechanisms for demonstration project participants based on: (1) a tiered system for initial rents for extremely low-income families, very low-income families, and low-income families; (2) a certain range of gross income percentages; or (3) the existing method for establishing rents.</p> <p>A small PHA may elect to be paid for its utility and waste management costs under a HUD assistance formula for a period, at its discretion, of up to 20 years based on its average annual consumption during the three-year period preceding the year in which the election is made.</p> <p>HUD shall develop and deploy all electronic information systems necessary to accommodate full consolidated reporting by PHAs electing to operate in consortia.</p>]]></summary-text>
