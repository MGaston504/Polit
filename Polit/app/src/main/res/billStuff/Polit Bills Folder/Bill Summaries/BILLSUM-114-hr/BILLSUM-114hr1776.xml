<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Shut Down the Shutdowns Act or the Don't Interrupt America Act </b></p> <p>This bill prevents a government shutdown by automatically providing continuing appropriations to a federal agency if an appropriation expires prior to passage of a new appropriations measure funding the agency. If the prior appropriation expires before new appropriations are provided, the bill appropriates funds to the agency at the rate of the previous appropriation and under the same terms and conditions. </p>]]></summary-text>
