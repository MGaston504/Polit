<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2010 to repeal the declaration that the deference that a court affords to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) regarding its determination of the meaning or interpretation of any provision of a federal consumer financial law shall be applied as if the CFPB were the only agency authorized to apply, enforce, interpret, or administer the provisions of that law.</p> <p>In any judicial review of a CFPB agency action, the reviewing court shall determine the meaning or applicability of the terms of a CFPB agency action and decide <i>de novo </i>all relevant questions of law, including the interpretation of constitutional and statutory provisions, as well as CFPB rules. No law may exempt any civil action for judicial review from the application of this bill except by specific reference to it.</p>]]></summary-text>
