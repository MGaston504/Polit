<summary-text><![CDATA[<b><p><b><b>Creating Higher Education Affordability Necessary to Compete Economically Act or the Middle Class CHANCE Act</b> </b> </b> <p>This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to modify provisions related to the Federal Pell Grant program. </p> <p>Specifically, it increases the maximum Federal Pell Grant award for academic year 2016-2017 and adjusts it in subsequent award years to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index. </p> <p>The bill also increases from one to two the number of Pell Grants an eligible student may receive in a single award year (i.e., it restores year-round Pell Grants). An eligible student is a student who has already received one Pell Grant for an award year and is enrolled in an eligible program for an additional payment period (e.g., a summer term) during the same award year. A student's total amount of Pell Grants must not exceed 150% of the maximum Pell Grant for that award year. Also, any period during which a student receives an additional Pell Grant counts toward that student's lifetime Pell Grant eligibility period. </p> <p>The bill increases from 12 to 15 semesters a student's lifetime Federal Pell Grant eligibility period. </p>]]></summary-text>
