<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Armor-Piercing Bullets Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>Amends the federal criminal code to provide that: (1) a .22 caliber projectile that would otherwise constitute &quot;armor piercing ammunition&quot; shall be considered to be primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes (and thus excluded from the definition of &quot;armor piercing ammunition&quot; for purposes of federal firearms provisions) if the projectile weighs 40 grains or less and is loaded into a rimfire cartridge, and (2) a projectile that would otherwise constitute &quot;armor piercing ammunition&quot; shall be considered to be primarily intended to be used for a sporting purpose if the projectile is loaded into a cartridge for which the only handgun that is readily available in the ordinary channels of commercial trade is a single shot handgun. </p> <p>Defines a &quot;single shot handgun&quot; as a break-open or bolt action handgun that can accept only a single cartridge manually and that does not accept or use a magazine or other ammunition feeding device, excluding a pocket pistol or derringer-type firearm.</p> <p>Authorizes the Attorney General to treat a projectile as not primarily intended to be used for sporting purposes if substantial evidence exists that the projectile is not primarily intended to be used for such purposes.</p>]]></summary-text>
