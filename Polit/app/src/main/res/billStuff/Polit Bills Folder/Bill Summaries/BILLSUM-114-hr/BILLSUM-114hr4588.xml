<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Incentivizing Medicaid Expansion Act of 2016</strong></p> <p>This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to provide the enhanced federal medical assistance percentage (FMAP) to every state that expands Medicaid&nbsp;coverage for&nbsp;individuals who are newly eligible under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, regardless of when&nbsp;such expansion takes place. </p> <p>Under current law, the enhanced FMAP is equivalent to 100% in 2014 through 2016, 95% in 2017, 94% in 2018, 93% in 2019, and 90% thereafter. The bill retains this enhanced FMAP, but bases it on a term of years rather than on specific dates.</p> <p>The bill applies retroactively.</p>]]></summary-text>
