<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This joint resolution disapproves and nullifies a Department of Labor rule published on April 8, 2016, relating to the definition of the term &quot;fiduciary&quot; and the conflict of interest rule with respect to retirement investment advice.</p> <p>(The rule defines who is a fiduciary with respect to pension and retirement plans. Under current law, a person who provides investment advice has a fiduciary obligation that requires the person to provide advice in the sole interest of plan participants and beneficiaries. The rule changes the definition of &quot;investment advice&quot; to treat people who provide investment advice to pension and retirement plans for a fee or other compensation as fiduciaries in a wider array of advice relationships.)</p>]]></summary-text>
