<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Education Stability for Foster Youth Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require a state plan for academic content and achievement standards to describe how the state will ensure the educational stability of children in foster care. Specifically, a state plan must include assurances that: (1) a foster child will remain or be enrolled in the child&rsquo;s school of origin absent a determination that such enrollment is not in the child&rsquo;s best interest; (2) if such a determination is made, the child will be immediately enrolled in a new school, which must immediately contact the child&rsquo;s previous school to obtain relevant records; and (3) the state will designate a point of contact for child welfare agencies, who shall also oversee implementation of the state&rsquo;s responsibilities under the bill. </p> <p>Relatedly, a local educational agency (LEA) plan must provide assurances that the LEA will develop and implement procedures governing the provision and funding of transportation services necessary to maintain a foster child&rsquo;s enrollment in the child&rsquo;s school of origin.</p> <p>This bill amends the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to alter the definition of &ldquo;homeless children and youths&rdquo; to no longer include children who are awaiting foster care placement.</p>]]></summary-text>
