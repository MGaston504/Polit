<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Seniors Tax Hike Prevention Act of 2016 </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) to extend through 2018, the rule that permits individuals who are 65 and older to deduct certain medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of adjusted gross income. (Under current law, the rule that reduces the 10% threshold for the medical expense deduction to 7.5% if a taxpayer or a taxpayer's spouse is 65 or older expires at the end of 2016.) </p> <p>The bill also expresses the sense of the Senate that the reduction in revenues resulting from this bill should be offset by an appropriate amendment to the IRC. </p>]]></summary-text>
