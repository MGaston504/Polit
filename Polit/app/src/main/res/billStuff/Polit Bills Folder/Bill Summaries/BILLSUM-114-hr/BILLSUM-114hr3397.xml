<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Disaster Savings and Resilient Construction Act of 2015</strong></p> <p> Amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a business-related tax credit for a specified portion of the cost of commercial and residential buildings&nbsp;that comply with resilient construction requirements in a federally-declared major disaster area. Defines "resilient construction requirements" as&nbsp;requirements that such&nbsp;buildings are designed and constructed to: (1) resist hazards brought&nbsp;on by a major disaster; (2) continue to provide their primary functions after a major disaster; (3) reduce the magnitude or duration of a disruptive event; and (4)&nbsp;have the absorptive capacity, adaptive capacity, and recoverability to withstand a potentially disruptive event. </p> <p>Terminates such credit for any any property for which a certificate of occupancy is issued after December 31, 2019.</p>]]></summary-text>
