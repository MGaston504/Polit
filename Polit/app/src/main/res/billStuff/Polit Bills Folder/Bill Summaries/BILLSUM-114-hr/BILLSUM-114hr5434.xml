<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Stop Debt Collection Abuse Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act to redefine: (1) "debt" to include any obligation or alleged obligation of a consumer to pay a loan, an overpayment, a fine, penalty, a fee, or other money owed currently or originally to a federal agency and that is at least 180 days past due; and (2) "debt collector" to include any person who regularly collects debts currently or originally owed or allegedly owed to a federal agency. </p> <p>A federal agency that is a creditor may sell or transfer a debt to a debt collector beginning 90 days after the obligation or alleged obligation becomes delinquent or defaults. </p> <p>The Act is further amended by making the collection of any amount (including any interest, fee, charge, or expense incidental to the principal obligation) an unfair practice unless:</p> <ul> <li>the amount is expressly authorized by the agreement creating the debt or permitted by law (as under current law); and</li> <li>in the case of a debt owed a federal agency as specified in this bill, the collection charge is reasonable in relation to actual collection costs, is authorized by a contract between the debt collector and the federal agency, and does not exceed 10% of the amount the debt collector collects. </li> </ul> <p>The Government Accountability Office shall study the use of debt collectors by federal, state, and local government agencies.</p>]]></summary-text>
