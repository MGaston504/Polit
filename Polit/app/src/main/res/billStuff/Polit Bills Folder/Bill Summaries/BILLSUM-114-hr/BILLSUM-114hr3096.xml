<summary-text><![CDATA[<p></p> <p>This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education (ED) to award competitive, three-year grants to states or local educational agencies (LEAs) for the establishment, improvement, and expansion of innovative model programs in world language education for elementary and secondary school students. Of the funds made available for this purpose, at least 75% must be used to expand world language learning in the elementary grades. ED may reserve up to 5% of funds made available for one fiscal year to evaluate the efficacy of assisted programs.</p> <p>In general, the federal share of the cost of such programs shall be 50% for each fiscal year. However, ED may determine the federal share for any LEA that is determined to have inadequate resources to pay the nonfederal share of program costs. </p> <p>ED must give special consideration to grant applications describing programs that: (1) include intensive summer programs for professional development of world language teachers; (2) promote sequential learning, two-way language learning, and innovative activities; (3) make effective use of technology; and (4) are carried out through a consortium comprised of the grant recipient and an elementary or secondary school.</p>]]></summary-text>
