<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Riegle Community Development and Regulatory Improvement Act of 1994 to require the Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) Fund to provide outreach and training with respect to the New Markets Tax Credit (NMTC) in low-income communities with a disproportionately low amount of low-income community investments by community development entities. </p> <p>(The NMTC is a non-refundable tax credit intended to encourage private capital investment in low-income communities. NMTCs are allocated by the CDFI Fund, a bureau of the Department of the Treasury, using a competitive application process.) </p> <p>The CFDI Fund must also: (1) include in the application for the NMTC questions to determine and consider, as an innovative use or a comparable incentive in evaluating applications, the extent to which the applicant intends to make low-income community investments within Indian country; and (2) to the maximum extent practicable, ensure that at least one community development entity whose primary mission is to fund projects within or that directly benefit Indian country receives an allocation for each allocation round. </p>]]></summary-text>
