<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Federal Power Act to authorize the Secretary of Energy to require an entity that owns, controls, or operates a bulk-power system facility to take whatever actions the Secretary determines will best avert or mitigate a cyber security threat pursuant to a written notice from the President that immediate action is necessary to protect the bulk-power system from such threat.</p> <p>The Secretary is encouraged to coordinate with Canadian and Mexican officials responsible for the protection of cyber security of the interconnected North American electricity grid.</p> <p>The Secretary, before exercising this authority, shall consult about the cyber security threat with: (1) the entities indicated, (2) the Electric Reliability Organization, (3) the Electricity Sub-sector Coordinating Council, and (4) other appropriate federal officials. </p> <p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission shall establish a mechanism that permits owners, operators, or users of the bulk-power system to seek recovery of prudently incurred costs required to implement actions ordered by the Secretary.</p> <p>Rates or charges approved under this mechanism must be just and reasonable, and neither unduly discriminatory nor preferential.</p> <p>Emergency orders under the bill are limited to a 30-day period unless the Secretary: (1) provides interested persons an opportunity to submit written data, recommendations, and arguments; and (2) affirms, amends (for up to 90 days), or repeals the order.</p> </p>]]></summary-text>
