<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Expanding Proven Financing for American Employers Act </b></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill amends the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to permit the manager of a qualified collateralized loan obligation, or one or more of the majority-owned affiliates of the manager (or its knowledgeable employees and other employees), to meet the risk retention requirement for a qualified collateralized loan obligation by the purchase and holding (without transferring the credit risk) of the value of at least 5% of the equity distributed among each of the higher tranches of the issuance with at least 3.5% retained as equity of the collateralized loan obligation.</p> <p>The bill prescribes characteristics of a qualified collateralized loan obligation with respect to: </p> <ul> <li> asset quality protections that have at least 100% of the obligation's assets composed of senior secured loans and cash equivalents,</li> <li> asset portfolio protections, </li> <li> structural protections,</li> <li> alignment of manager and investor interests,</li> <li> regulatory oversight requirements, and </li> <li> transparency and disclosure requirements.</li> </ul> <p> Further criteria for the asset quality protections for a qualified collaterilized loan obligation require that the obligation:</p> <ul> <li> have 100% of its loan assets issued by companies;</li> <li>have no assets that are asset-backed securities or derivatives (except for an acquired loan participation, any interest related to or in a letter of credit, or a derivative transaction to hedge interest rate or currency rate mismatches);</li> <li>not purchase assets in default, margin stock, or equity convertible securities;</li> <li>acquire only loans held or acquired by three or more investors or lenders unaffiliated with the manager;</li> <li>hold only loans to borrowers whose financial statements are subject to an annual audit from an independent, accredited accounting firm; and </li> <li>have no more than 60% of its assets composed of covenant lite loans, except that each asset shall require disclosure of unaudited quarterly financial statements and of audited annual financial statements.</li> </ul> <p>A &quot;covenant lite loan&quot; (or &quot;cov-lite,&quot; commonly a loan agreement that does not contain the usual protective covenants for the benefit of the lending party) shall mean in this bill, at the time a collateralized loan obligation enters into a commitment to acquire it, a loan for which the underlying instruments neither: </p> <ul> <li>require the obligor to comply with any maintenance covenant; nor <li>contain a cross-default provision to a financing facility of the obligor that requires the obligor to comply with a maintenance covenant (including one that may apply only upon the funding of such other loan or financing facility). </ul> <p>If any such loan is <i>pari passu</i> (treated equally and without preference) with another loan of the obligor that would not be a covenant lite loan, such loan shall be deemed not to be a covenant lite loan.</p>]]></summary-text>
