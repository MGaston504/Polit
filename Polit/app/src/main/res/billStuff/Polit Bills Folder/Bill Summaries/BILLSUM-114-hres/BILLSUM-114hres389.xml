<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Honest Dynamic Scoring Resolution</b></p> <p>Amends Rule XIII (Calendars and Committee Reports) of the Rules of the House of Representatives to revise the threshold at which a piece of major legislation's gross budgetary effect requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to provide cost estimates that incorporate macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation (dynamic scoring).</p> <p>Changes the threshold from 0.25% of the current projected gross domestic product for that fiscal year to 1% of the total amount of discretionary spending in the most recently ended fiscal year.</p> <p>Requires a CBO cost estimate for any appropriation bill or joint resolution which funds a project, program, or activity authorized by major legislation to incorporate the budgetary effects of changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.</p> <p>Requires the central value within a range to be used for official scoring purposes if CBO provides a range of estimates in addition to a central value for such legislation.</p> <p>Authorizes CBO to use traditional scoring methods when making such an estimate if the estimate will be the same under both that method and the dynamic scoring method.</p>]]></summary-text>
