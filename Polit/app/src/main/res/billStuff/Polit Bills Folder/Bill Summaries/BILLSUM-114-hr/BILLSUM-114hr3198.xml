<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Small Business Jobs Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a qualified small employer a business-related tax credit for the cost of hiring up to 5 new employees who work for such employer, on average, at least 30 hours per week. The bill defines &quot;qualified small employer&quot; as an employer who: (1) has a place of business in a county with an annual unemployment rate that is at least 1% greater than the national rate for the preceding calendar year; and (2) did not employ fewer than 2, or more than 100, employees in the preceding calendar year. The bill allows an employer who is a tax-exempt organization to claim such credit. The credit is not available for wages paid after December 31, 2017. </p>]]></summary-text>
