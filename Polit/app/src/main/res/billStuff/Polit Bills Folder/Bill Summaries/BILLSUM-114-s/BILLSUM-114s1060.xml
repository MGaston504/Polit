<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Pell Grant Protection Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends title IV (Student Assistance) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 to appropriate for each fiscal year beginning with FY2016 the funding necessary to provide each eligible student with the maximum Pell Grant amount, minus the student's expected family contribution.
