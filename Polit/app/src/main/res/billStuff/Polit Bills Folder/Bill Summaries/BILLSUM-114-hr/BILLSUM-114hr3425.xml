<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Firearm Rights Equally Enforced Act or the FREE Act</strong></p> <p>Amends the federal criminal code to permit an individual who is not prohibited from receiving a firearm under federal law, and to whom a state has issued a license or permit either to carry a concealed firearm or to carry a firearm that is partially or fully visible to the public, to carry a firearm in any other state, subject to the limitations imposed by the state that issued the license or permit. </p> <p>Authorizes a state to: (1) impose a less restrictive limitation than the state that issued the license or permit; and (2) condition the exercise of such right upon the payment of a fee, as long as such fee is not set at a level that unduly burdens the exercise of the right.</p> <ul> </ul>]]></summary-text>
