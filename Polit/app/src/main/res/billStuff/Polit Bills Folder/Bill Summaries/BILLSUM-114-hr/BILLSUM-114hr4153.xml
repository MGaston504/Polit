<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Educating to Prevent Eating Disorders Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Public Health Service Act to permit the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to establish a pilot program to provide students with interventions for eating disorders. Under this pilot program, grants must be awarded to schools that serve students in grades 6-8 and need a nurse trained in recognizing and responding to eating disorders.</p> Schools must use these grants to develop best practices for health care providers to assess, recognize, and respond to students with eating disorders and to hire a health care provider to: (1) follow these best practices, (2) provide information and seminars on eating disorders to teachers and parents, and (3) otherwise serve as a full time health care provider for the school.]]></summary-text>
