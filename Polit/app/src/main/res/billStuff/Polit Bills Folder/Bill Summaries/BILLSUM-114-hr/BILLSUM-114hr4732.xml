<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Advancing Medical Resident Training in Community Hospitals Act of 2016</strong></p> <p>This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to&nbsp;revise payment rules for graduate medical education (GME) costs with respect to a hospital that establishes a new medical residency training program. </p> <p>With respect to a hospital that has not entered into a GME affiliation agreement, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) shall establish the hospital's full-time equivalent (FTE) resident amount only after determining that the hospital's medical residency training program trains more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period. In the case of a hospital with an approved FTE resident amount based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its FTE resident amount reestablished when the hospital begins&nbsp;training FTE residents&nbsp;in excess of&nbsp;the&nbsp;applicable threshold. </p> <p>Current law limits the number, subject to&nbsp;the application of&nbsp;certain adjustments,&nbsp;of FTE residents a hospital may have in allopathic and osteopathic medicine for purposes of Medicare payment. The bill specifies that CMS shall determine a hospital's&nbsp;limitation&nbsp;adjustment only after determining that the hospital's medical residency training program trains&nbsp;more than 1.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period. In the case of a hospital with a limitation adjustment based on the training of no more than 1.0 FTE resident in a cost reporting period before October 1, 1997, or 3.0 FTE residents in a cost reporting period after that date, CMS shall provide the hospital an opportunity to have its&nbsp;adjustment re-determined&nbsp;when the hospital begins&nbsp;training FTE residents&nbsp;in excess of&nbsp;the&nbsp;applicable threshold. </p>]]></summary-text>
