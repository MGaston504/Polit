<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Mortgage Fairness Act of 2015</b> </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Truth in Lending Act to revise points and fees under a high-cost mortgage which currently include all compensation paid directly or indirectly by a consumer or creditor to a mortgage originator from any source, including a mortgage originator that is also the creditor in a table-funded transaction.</p> <p>&quot;Table funding&quot; means a settlement at which a loan is funded by a contemporaneous advance of loan funds and an assignment of the loan to the person advancing the funds. A table-funded transaction is not a transaction in the secondary mortgage.</p> <p>Compensation from any source shall not include any compensation taken into account in settling the mortgage interest rate and for which there is no separate charge to the consumer.</p> <p>Such compensation shall include, however, any other compensation paid directly or indirectly by a consumer or creditor to an individual employed by or contracting with the originator or a mortgage originator.</p>]]></summary-text>
