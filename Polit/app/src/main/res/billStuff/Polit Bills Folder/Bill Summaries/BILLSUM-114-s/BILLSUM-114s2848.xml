<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Highlights:</b></p> <p>This bill authorizes, deauthorizes, and revises various U.S. Army Corps of Engineers water resources development and conservation projects, feasibility studies, and relationships with nonfederal project sponsors. The Corps of Engineers may carry out final feasibility studies for projects in Arkansas, California, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maine, Missouri, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. </p> <p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) must establish a grant program to rehabilitate nonfederal dams posing an unacceptable risk to the public. </p> <p>Additional assistance is provided to states with emergency public health threats associated with lead or other contaminants in a public drinking water supply system. The Department of Justice and the inspector general of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must report on any ongoing investigations into the government's response to the drinking water contamination in Flint, Michigan.</p> <p>The Safe Drinking Water Act and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (commonly known as the Clean Water Act) are amended to set forth funding priorities and make additional subsidization available to projects that use state revolving loan funds for innovative water technologies. The EPA must establish grant programs for: (1) community water systems serving disadvantaged communities, (2) reduction of lead in water for human consumption, (3) voluntary school and child care lead testing, and (4) innovations that address water challenges. </p> <p>Public water systems must notify their customers of lead levels in drinking water that exceed limits under national primary drinking water regulations. </p> <p>The bill revises and reauthorizes through FY2021: </p> <ul> <li>the Water Desalination Act of 1996, with a list of funding priorities; </li> <li>the Department of the Interior program for making grants to state water resources research and technology institutes; </li> <li>the EPA's grants to states for sewer overflow control grants to municipalities, which may be used for stormwater or subsurface drainage water projects;</li> <li> the EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative; and </li> <li>the Long Island Sound Restoration Program. </li> </ul> <p>The U.S. Forest Service's administration of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act is revised and reauthorized for 10 fiscal years after enactment of this bill.</p> <p><b>Full Summary:</b></p> <p><b>Water Resources Development Act of 2016</b></p> <p>TITLE I--PROGRAM REFORMS</p> <p>(Sec. 1001) This bill amends the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 (WRDA 1986) to allow the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to provide technical assistance to nonfederal interests for feasibility studies of proposed water resources development projects if the nonfederal interest contracts to pay the costs of such assistance. </p> <p>(Sec. 1002) The Corps of Engineers may receive and repay funds from states or political subdivisions for immediate use on authorized water resources development studies or projects (currently, only flood-control projects). The definition of "state" for such purposes is expanded to include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, other U.S. territories or possessions, federally recognized Indian tribes, and other native entities. </p> <p>(Sec. 1003) The Water Resources Reform and Development Act of 2014 (WRRDA 2014) is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to accept materials, services, or funds from a nonfederal public entity, a nonprofit entity, or a private entity to repair, restore, replace, or maintain a water resources project if there is a risk of adverse impacts to the functioning of the project. (Under current law, the Corps may accept only materials or services for repairing, restoring, or replacing such a project that has been damaged or destroyed as a result of an emergency.)</p> <p>(Sec. 1004) The Corps of Engineers may partner with nonfederal interests to maintain a project, but nonfederal interest partners are ineligible for reimbursement for their contributed materials, services, or funds. </p> <p>(Sec. 1005) The Corps of Engineers may accept and expend funds provided by nonfederal interests to undertake reviews, inspections, monitoring, and other federal activities related to nonfederal interests carrying out the study, design, or construction of water resources development projects under WRDA 1986. In determining credit or reimbursement, the Corps may include the amount of such funds provided by a nonfederal interest as a cost of the study, design, or construction.</p> <p>(Sec. 1006) The Corps of Engineers' funding of response actions to address human health and environmental threats from military munitions deposited on a beach shall be reimbursed from amounts made available to the Department of Defense&nbsp;agency responsible for the original release of the munitions.</p> <p>(Sec. 1007) The Water Resources Development Act of 1992 (WRDA 1992) is amended to authorize the Corps of Engineers to allow a nonfederal public or private entity that has entered into a cooperative agreement for the operation and management of recreation facilities and natural resources at civil works projects under the Corps' jurisdiction to collect user fees for the use of developed recreation sites and facilities, whether developed or constructed by such entity or the Corps. </p> <p>An entity may: (1) use any visitor reservation service that the Corps of Engineers has provided for by contract or interagency agreement to manage fee collections and reservations, subject to the Corps' terms and conditions; and (2) retain the fees collected to pay for operation, maintenance, and management at the recreation site where they were collected.</p> <p>(Sec. 1008) An Army district engineer (currently, the Army Secretary, on the recommendation of the Chief of Engineers) may grant permission for alterations to a federal levee, floodwall, or flood risk management channel project. If such an activity requires review under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA), the review and approval shall occur concurrently. If the Corps of Engineers is not the lead federal agency for such an environmental review, the Corps shall participate as a cooperating agency and use the same documents prepared under NEPA.</p> <p>(Sec. 1009) To complete certain environmental infrastructure projects under WRDA 1992 that are already under construction (having received more than $4 million in federal appropriations when those appropriations are greater than 80% of the authorized amount), the bill increases authorized appropriations to allow completion of projects that have made significant progress if the benefits of the federal investment will not be realized without the increase.</p> <p>(Sec. 1010) The Flood Control Act of 1936 is amended to allow the Corps of Engineers to receive funds from nonfederal interests without the current requirement that federal funds be appropriated for&nbsp;a study or project.</p> <p>(Sec. 1011) To analyze the benefits of offshore oil and gas fabrication port navigation projects authorized after November 7, 2007, the recommended plan by the Corps of Engineers must use the value of future energy exploration and production fabrication contracts and the transportation savings that would result from a larger navigation channel under the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act for Defense, the Global War on Terror, and Tsunami Relief, 2005. These requirements also apply to: (1) a project that has undergone an economic benefits update, and (2) ongoing feasibility studies at the request of a nonfederal sponsor.</p> <p>(Sec. 1012) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal interest's request, must review proposals to increase the quantity of available water supplies through: (1) modification of a water resources project, (2) modification of how a project is managed, or (3) access to water released from a project. The cost of developing, reviewing, and implementing a proposal shall be provided by a nonfederal entity.</p> <p>This section shall not apply to Corps-owned and -operated reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, or the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river system.</p> <p>(Sec. 1013) The Corps of Engineers' revolving fund for maintenance and operation of plants and equipment may be used to construct buildings for its New England district headquarters in Bedford, Massachusetts, and its district headquarters in Buffalo, New York.</p> <p>(Sec. 1015) Monitoring plans for ecosystem restoration projects must describe: (1) the types and number of restoration activities, (2) the physical action to be undertaken, (3) the functions and values that will result from the restoration plan, and (4) the contingency plan for taking any corrective actions. The nonfederal sponsor's responsibility for operation and maintenance of a restoration project shall cease 10 years after the Corps of Engineers makes a determination of success.</p> <p>(Sec. 1016) In water resources projects in which a nonfederal interest has entered into a partnership agreement with the Corps of Engineers to receive a credit for the nonfederal interest's in-kind contributions, the maximum amount of credit shall be based on the value of the contributions rather than the cost incurred by the nonfederal sponsor.</p> <p>(Sec. 1017) The Corps of Engineers must develop a structural health monitoring program to assess and improve the condition of Corps infrastructure, including systems and frameworks for: (1) response to floods and earthquakes, (2) pre-disaster mitigation measures, (3) lengthening the useful life of the infrastructure, and (4) identifying risks due to sea level rise.</p> <p>(Sec. 1018) Habitat connectivity protection and restoration measures must be included in programmatic mitigation plans to address potential impacts to ecological resources, fish, and wildlife. The Corps of Engineers may use preconstruction engineering and design funds prior to authorization of project construction to: (1) satisfy mitigation requirements through third-party arrangements, or (2) acquire land interests necessary to meet mitigation requirements.</p> <p>(Sec. 1019) The categories of "nonfederal interests" under the Flood Control Act of 1970 are expanded to include Alaska native villages, regional corporations, or village corporations among the entities that may enter partnership agreements with the Corps of Engineers for implementation or construction of water resources projects.</p> <p>(Sec. 1020) The Corps of Engineers may credit or reimburse discrete segments of projects that function independently in advance of completion of the total project or a project element. If the nonfederal interest receives reimbursement for a discrete segment of a project and fails to complete the entire project, the nonfederal interest must repay the amount of the reimbursement, plus interest.</p> <p>(Sec. 1021) The Corps of Engineers may accept funds from a rail carrier to expedite the evaluation of the rail carrier's permits for a project under the Corps' jurisdiction.</p> <p>(Sec. 1022) The Corps of Engineers' international outreach program is expanded to include informing the United States of technological innovations abroad that could improve any water resources development in the United States, including technology transfers or exchanges. (Under current law, the program is limited to informing the maritime industry and port authorities about innovations that could improve waterborne transportation.)</p> <p>(Sec. 1023) The Corps of Engineers must issue implementation guidance for water resources projects involving wetlands mitigation that impacts the service area of a mitigation bank. The guidance must provide for consideration of the entire amount of potential credits available at in-kind, in-basin mitigation banks and in-lieu fee programs for water resource development project feasibility studies. All potential mitigation bank and in-lieu fee credits shall be considered reasonable alternatives if the mitigation bank: (1) has an approved mitigation banking instrument, and (2) has completed a functional analysis of the potential credits using the approved Corps-certified habitat assessment model specific to the region.</p> <p>(Sec. 1024) The Corps of Engineers must encourage Corps districts to enter cooperative agreements with youth service and conservation corps for natural resources conservation or recreation management services.</p> <p>(Sec. 1025) The bill increases the Corps of Engineers' annual maximum allotment for debris removal from rivers, harbors, streams, and tributaries. It expands the authorized activities to include: (1) the removal of obstructions located in or adjacent to a federal channel, and (2) the clearing or straightening of channels for recreation.</p> <p>(Sec. 1026) The Government Accountability Office (GAO) must report on the shellfish aquaculture industry in the Chesapeake Bay, Gulf Coast states, California, and Washington.</p> <p>(Sec. 1027) The Corps of Engineers is prohibited from removing existing vegetation on levees until revised guidelines are adopted, unless the vegetation presents an unacceptable safety risk. The Corps must explain why it has not met deadlines for revising such guidelines.</p> (Sec. 1028) The Corps of Engineers may cooperate with nonfederal interests working with a group of states, or a consortia of states, in the preparation of comprehensive plans for drainage basins, watersheds, or ecosystems. <p>(Sec. 1029) The Corps of Engineers may give funding priority to projects that restore coastal wetlands that reduce the impact of storm surge.</p> <p>(Sec. 1030) The Corps of Engineers must transfer the human remains known as Kennewick Man or the Ancient One to the Washington State Department of Archaeology and Historic Preservation on the condition that it dispose of and repatriate the remains to the Indian tribes and band referred to in the letter from Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt to Secretary of the Army Louis Caldera, dated September 21, 2000. </p> <p>(Sec. 1031) The Corps of Engineers' inventory of properties that are not needed for Corps missions must consider the extent to which the property has economic, cultural, historic, or recreational significance or impacts at the national, state, or local level.</p> <p>(Sec. 1032) At the request of a nonfederal entity, the Corps of Engineers must review reservoir operations using improved weather forecasts and run-off forecasting methods. Within three years after completing a review, the Army must incorporate into the operation of the reservoir any improvements for flood risk reduction, water supply, recreation, or fish and wildlife protection and mitigation. Priority must be given to areas with prolonged droughts for which no review has occurred during the preceding 10 years. These requirements are inapplicable to Corps reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River, the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint river system, and the Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa river system.</p> <p>Prior to implementing a change in operations, the Corps must consult with: (1) nonfederal entities operating or maintaining costs of a federal facility, (2) individuals and entities with storage entitlements, and (3) local agencies with flood control responsibilities downstream of a facility. </p> <p>(Sec. 1033) The bill makes permanent the Corps of Engineers' authority to apply credit for in-kind contributions provided by a nonfederal interest that are in excess of the required nonfederal cost share for a project toward the required nonfederal cost share for a different water resources development study or project. A nonfederal interest may request that the credit be applied at reasonable intervals prior to completion of the study or project.</p> <p>(Sec. 1034) The Corps of Engineers must issue a decision on requests for contracts for surplus water from Upper Missouri reservoirs within 60 days after receiving a request. If the Corps has not documented the volume of surplus water available, the Corps must identify the outstanding information necessary to make a decision and set a date for the final decision.</p> <p>(Sec. 1035) The bill increases the maximum amount that the Corps of Engineers may expend for small shore and beach restoration and protection projects not specifically authorized by Congress.</p> <p>(Sec. 1036) The Corps of Engineers may operate a fish hatchery to restore a population of threatened or endangered fish species. Nonfederal entities or other federal agencies shall be responsible for all additional costs associated with managing such a fish hatchery that are not authorized as of the enactment of this bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 1037) The first $100,000 of a watershed assessment or feasibility study for a water resources project shall be a federal expense. </p> <p>(Sec. 1038) The River and Harbor Act of 1968 is amended to provide for: (1) feasibility studies to be cost-shared in the same proportion as construction of projects, and (2) reimbursements to nonfederal interests if they expend more than their share of study costs. </p> <p>TITLE II--NAVIGATION</p> <p>(Sec. 2001) Projects authorized to receive funding from the Inland Waterways Trust Fund are exempted temporarily from a process that deauthorizes unconstructed projects for which funds have not been obligated for a specified preceding period of years.

The Corps of Engineers may accept funds from a nonfederal interest to dispose of such dredged material for private shores or lands that are ineligible for federal cost sharing.</p> <p>(Sec. 2009) The bill extends through FY2025: (1) the requirement that the Corps of Engineers allocate for emerging harbor projects at least 10% percent of the funds made available under the HMTF for FY2015 (currently FY2012) to pay the operation and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of all harbors and inland harbors within the United States, and (2) the Corps of Engineers' authority to provide funds to donor ports and energy transfer ports.</p> <p>(Sec. 2011) The bill extends to contracts for physical construction that have not been awarded before enactment of WRRDA 2014 the formula that calculates the harbor deepening costs to be paid by nonfederal interests during construction for harbor or inland harbor navigation projects. For the portion of a project that has a depth in excess of 45 feet but not in excess of 50 feet, the cost to be paid by nonfederal interests is decreased from 50% to 25% of the cost of construction for that portion.</p> <p>(Sec. 2012) The Corps of Engineers must carry out dredging activities on shallow draft ports located on the inland Mississippi River to the authorized widths and depths.</p> <p>(Sec. 2013) The Corps of Engineers must publish guidance for the implementation of WRRDA 2014 provisions concerning maintenance of emerging ports and Great Lakes ports.</p> <p>(Sec. 2014) The Corps of Engineers' justification for a harbor and navigation improvements project may include the long-term viability of a community that is located in the region that is served by, and that will rely on, the project.</p> <p>(Sec. 2015) The Corps of Engineers may permit a nonfederal interest to carry out maintenance activities necessary to ensure that a navigation project is maintained to not less than the minimum project dimensions. Costs incurred by the nonfederal interest are eligible for reimbursement up to the estimated federal cost, but are limited to costs directly related to the performance of work for the federal government and the actual fiscal year appropriations for that portion of maintenance dredging. In carrying out the maintenance activities, the nonfederal interest shall: (1) provide equipment at no cost to the federal government, and (2) hold the United States free from damages that arise from the use of the equipment. This section terminates 10 years after enactment of this bill. </p> <p>(Sec. 2016) The Corps of Engineers' next biennial HMTF report on operations and maintenance costs assigned to commercial navigation of harbors and inland harbors must identify transportation cost savings realized by achieving and maintaining the constructed width and depth for such harbors on a project-by-project basis. This requirement does not apply to subsequent reports.</p> <p>(Sec. 2017) The Corps of Engineers may place dredged material from the operation and maintenance of an authorized federal water resources project at another authorized water resource project if, for a reasonable cost, the placement would: (1) enhance protection from flooding caused by storm surges or sea level rise, or (2) significantly contribute to shoreline resiliency or wetland restoration. The Corps shall not require a nonfederal entity to bear any increased costs associated with the placement of dredged material at another project if it exceeds the cost of depositing the dredged material in accordance with federal regulations.</p> <p>TITLE III--SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS</p> <p>(Sec. 3001) The Corps of Engineers, at a nonfederal sponsor's request, may use the natural disaster emergency fund to repair or restore flood control work, hurricane or shore protective structures, or the depths of federal navigable channels or waterways to an increased pumping capacity or a level of protection above the system design. The nonfederal sponsor must agree to pay the difference between the cost of restoration to the original design level and the cost of achieving the higher level of protection. The Corps must notify nonfederal sponsors of the opportunity to request nonstructural alternatives to restore or protect natural resources (including streams, rivers, floodplains, wetlands, or coasts) if those efforts will reduce flood risk.</p> <p>(Sec. 3002) The bill authorizes a temporary program for the Corps of Engineers to address consolidation, settlement, subsidence, sea level rise, and new data to restore federally authorized hurricane and storm damage reduction projects through cost-share agreements with nonfederal partners.</p> <p>(Sec. 3003) If the Corps of Engineers is responsible for maintenance of a high risk flood control project, the Corps must continue to be responsible for such maintenance until the project is modified to reduce the risk, or until 15 years after enactment of this bill, whichever is earlier. </p> <p>(Sec. 3004) The National Dam Safety Program Act is amended to direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to establish a program to provide technical, planning, design, and construction assistance grants to nonfederal sponsors (subject to a nonfederal cost-sharing requirement of at least 35%) for rehabilitation of eligible high hazard potential dams. </p> <p>An &quot;eligible high hazard potential dam&quot; is a nonfederal dam that: </p> <ul> <li>is located in a state with a state dam safety program,</li> <li>is classified as high hazard potential by the dam safety agency of the state in which the dam is located,</li> <li>has an emergency action plan approved by such agency, and </li> <li>fails to meet minimum state dam safety standards and poses an unacceptable risk to the public. </li> </ul> <p>An eligible high hazard potential dam does not include a licensed hydroelectric dam or a dam built under the authority of the Department of Agriculture (USDA). </p> <p>FEMA shall require a grant recipient to provide an assurance that the owner of the dam has developed and will carry out a plan for maintenance of the dam during its expected life. A grant must be approved by the relevant state dam safety agency. </p> <p>Grant funds shall be allocated to all states from which applications are submitted based on each state's relative number of eligible high hazard potential dams compared to all states. </p> <p>Grant funds may not be used to: </p> <ul> <li>rehabilitate a federal dam, </li> <li>perform routine operation or maintenance of a dam, </li> <li>modify a dam to produce hydroelectric power, </li> <li>increase water supply storage capacity, or </li> <li>make any other modification that does not also improve the safety of the dam. </li> </ul> <p>The bill sets forth requirements and conditions for nonfederal sponsors to receive such grants, including the demonstration of a floodplain management plan to reduce the impacts of future flood events. </p><p>TITLE IV--RIVER BASINS, WATERSHEDS, AND COASTAL AREAS</p> <p>(Sec. 4001) The Corps of Engineers must coordinate with Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas to develop a recovery plan for Gulf Coast oyster beds damaged by: (1) Hurricane Katrina in 2005, (2) the <i></i><i> Deepwater Horizon</i> oil spill in 2010, and (3) floods in 2011 and 2016.</p> <p>(Sec. 4002) The bill: (1) increases funding for ecosystem restoration projects for the lower Columbia River and Tillamook Bay estuaries in Oregon and Washington; (2) allows watercraft inspection stations to protect the Columbia River Basin from aquatic plant growths and invasive species to be located outside of Idaho, Montana, Oregon, and Washington; (3) addresses replacement housing for Indian families displaced by the construction of the Bonneville Dam and the John Day Dam; and (4) requires the Army to determine the feasibility of modifying projects to address safety risks for navigation of Columbia and Lower Willamette Rivers below Vancouver, Washington, and Portland, Oregon.</p> <p>(Sec. 4003) The Corps of Engineers, in partnership with the Department of the Interior, must carry out a pilot program to implement sediment management plans for Corps-owned and -operated reservoirs in the Upper Missouri River Basin, on request by project beneficiaries. The program may also apply to reservoirs managed or owned by the Bureau of Reclamation.</p> <p>The Corps of Engineers shall be the lead agency for soil moisture and snowpack monitoring projects in the Upper Missouri River Basin.</p> <p>(Sec. 4004) The bill increases the portion of the amount of appropriations authorized under the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 for critical ecosystem restoration projects in the area of Puget Sound, Washington, that may be used to carry out a single project. </p> <p>(Sec. 4005) The Corps of Engineers may carry out small flood control pilot projects with Corps laboratories, universities, government agencies, and private organizations to prevent and mitigate flood damages associated with ice jams.

or (2) replacing or rehabilitating aging treatment, storage, or distribution facilities or providing for capital projects to upgrade security.</p> <p>Funds may also be used by public water systems as a source of revenue (restricted solely to interest earnings of a state loan fund) or security for payment of the principal and interest on&nbsp;state bonds issued to provide state matching contributions under the EPA's capitalization program, if the proceeds of the sale of the bonds will be deposited in the state loan fund.</p> <p>(Sec. 7102) In the annual plans that states prepare to identify the intended uses of their loan funds under the capitalization program, states must prioritize projects that: (1) address the most serious human health risks, (2) ensure compliance with safe drinking water requirements, (3) assist systems most in need on a per-household basis according to state affordability criteria, and (4) improve system sustainability.</p> <p>States must give greater weight to loan applications by community water systems with utility management best practices, asset replacement schedules, financing plans with lifecycle costs, restructuring options, activities consistent with watershed plans, and conservation measures.</p> <p>States must update biennially a list of projects that are eligible for assistance from the capitalization loan program.</p> <p>(Sec. 7103) To administer state loan funds, states may use: (1) any fees collected by the state for use in covering reasonable costs of administration of programs under the fund; and (2) $400,000, a specified percentage of the current valuation of the fund, or 4% of all grant awards to the fund for the fiscal year, whichever is greatest.</p> <p>(Sec. 7104) States may use capitalization grants to implement source water protection plans, subject to&nbsp;fiscal year limitations.</p> <p>(Sec. 7105) For communities of more than 10,000 individuals, a contract to be carried out using state revolving funds shall be negotiated in the same manner as: (1) a federal contract for architectural and engineering services based on demonstrated competence and qualification at a fair and reasonable price, or (2) an equivalent state qualifications-based requirement.</p> <p>(Sec. 7106) The EPA must establish a program to award grants to community water systems serving disadvantaged communities (including communities that may become disadvantaged or communities of less than 10,000 individuals that do not have capacity to incur debt sufficient to finance a project) to carry out water quality testing and infrastructure investments necessary to comply with safe drinking water requirements. Priority must be given to communities with inadequate drinking water or wastewater systems.</p> <p>(Sec. 7107) The EPA must establish a grant program for projects that reduce the level of lead in water for human consumption through replacement of service lines, testing, planning, corrosion control, and education. Excluded from the program are partial lead service line replacements if drinking water is delivered to a household through a publicly or privately owned portion of a lead service line.</p> <p>Grant funds may be used to assist low-income homeowners in carrying out lead reduction projects, as long as the grant amount does not exceed the cost of replacing the privately owned portion of the service line. </p> <p>If an entity uses grant funds to replace lead service lines,&nbsp;it must: (1) notify customers of the replacement of any publicly owned portion of the line; (2) inform each customer that it will replace the public portions only if the customer agrees to simultaneously replace the privately owned portions; and (3) demonstrate that it has considered multiple options for reducing lead in drinking water, including an evaluation of options for corrosion control.</p> <p>(Sec. 7108) The EPA must appoint liaisons to minority, tribal, and low-income communities in each of its regional offices.</p> <p>(Sec. 7109) Public water systems must notify their customers of lead concentration levels in drinking water that exceed lead limits under national primary drinking water regulations. </p> <p>The EPA: (1) must notify the public within 15 days of the lead levels exceeding those limits if the public water system or the state does not notify the public, and (2) may notify the public or the local or state health department of the result of lead monitoring conducted by a public water system.</p> <p>If a violation has the potential to have serious adverse effects on human health as a result of short-term exposure, notice must be provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and state and county health agencies.</p> <p>(Sec. 7110) The EPA must require electronic submission of available compliance monitoring data by public water systems and states.</p> <p>(Sec. 7111) The EPA must establish a voluntary school and child care lead testing program of grants to states to assist local educational agencies in voluntary testing for lead contamination in drinking water at schools and child care programs. The bill repeals the current program of federal assistance for state programs regarding lead contamination in school drinking water.</p> <p>(Sec. 7112)&nbsp;The EPA's&nbsp;WaterSense program is&nbsp;authorized to identify products, buildings, landscapes, facilities, processes, and services that may voluntarily bear a "WaterSense" label identifying them as meeting water-efficiency performance criteria. A WaterSense label shall not create an express or implied warranty.</p> <p>(Sec. 7113) The EPA and the USDA must: (1) update their programs that provide drinking water technical assistance to include information on cost-effective, innovative, and alternative drinking water delivery systems; and (2) disseminate information on the cost effectiveness of alternative drinking water delivery systems, including wells, to communities and nonprofit organizations seeking federal funding for drinking water systems serving 500 or fewer persons. Applicants for funding for drinking water systems serving 500 or fewer persons must consider drinking water delivery systems sourced by publicly owned individual, shared, and community wells.</p> <p>Subtitle B--Clean Water</p> <p>(Sec. 7201) The Clean Water Act is amended to: (1) reauthorize through FY2021 the EPA's grants to states for purposes of providing sewer overflow control grants to municipalities, and (2) allow such grants to be used for stormwater or subsurface drainage water projects. </p> <p>(Sec. 7202) The EPA may provide grants or cooperative agreements to nonprofit technical assistance providers for publicly owned small (serving up to 10,000 individuals) and medium (serving between 10,000 and 100,000 individuals) treatment works to achieve clean water compliance or obtain financing for eligible projects. A state may use for such technical assistance an additional 2% of funds it is allotted annually for a water pollution control revolving fund.</p> <p>(Sec. 7203) The EPA must inform municipalities&nbsp;permitted to&nbsp;discharge pollutants of the opportunity to develop integrated plans to meet multiple clean water requirements under separate programs by sequencing investments to the highest priorities first. Municipalities that incorporate integrated plans may use a schedule of compliance under which actions to meet water quality-based effluent limitations may be implemented over multiple permit terms if compliance schedules are authorized by state water quality standards. Actions subject to such a compliance schedule may include green infrastructure measures that use plant or soil systems, permeable pavement or other permeable surfaces or substrates, stormwater harvest and reuse, or landscaping to store, infiltrate, or evapotranspirate stormwater and reduce flows to sewer systems or to surface waters.</p> <p>An Office of the Municipal Ombudsman is established within the EPA to: (1) provide technical assistance to municipalities seeking to comply with environmental laws, (2) ensure that EPA policies are implemented by regional offices, and (3) provide information to municipalities about available federal financial assistance. </p> <p>A municipality may request modification of administrative orders or settlement agreements based on an integrated plan. </p> <p>(Sec. 7204) The EPA must promote and coordinate the use of green infrastructure in permitting programs, planning efforts, research, technical assistance, and funding guidance.</p> <p>(Sec. 7205) Within one year after the National Academy of Public Administration completes its study to establish a definition and framework for community affordability, the EPA must revise its guidance entitled &quot;Combined Sewer Overflows-Guidance for Financial Capability Assessment and Schedule Development,&quot; dated February 1997, as applicable to the combined sewer and sanitary sewer overflows guidance entitled &quot;Financial Capability Assessment Framework,&quot; dated November 24, 2014.</p> <p>The EPA's revised guidance must consider local economic conditions and the potential adverse effects of rate structures on distressed populations and low-income consumers. The EPA is prohibited from using median household income as the sole indicator of affordability for a residential household.</p> <p>Subtitle C--Innovative Financing and Promotion of Innovative Technologies</p> <p>(Sec. 7301) Unless specifically provided for in subsequent appropriations Acts, the Corps of Engineers is not obligated to expend funds on the pilot program under WRRDA 2014 that allows nonfederal applicants to carry out authorized water resources development projects for coastal harbor improvement, channel improvement, inland navigation, flood damage reduction, aquatic ecosystem restoration, and hurricane and storm damage reduction.</p> <p>(Sec. 7302) The Water Infrastructure Finance and Innovation Act of 2014 (WIFIA) is amended to: (1) remove the pilot designation from the program that allows the Corps of Engineers and the EPA to provide financial assistance to ensure a diversity of projects types and geographical locations, and (2) allow such financial assistance to be used for chloride control in sea water desalination projects or alternative water supplies to reduce aquifer depletion. A community of not more than 10,000 individuals may request that any fees established by the Corps or the EPA to cover costs to the federal government of making secured loans for such projects be financed as part of the loan. Any eligible project costs incurred and the value of any integral in-kind contributions made before receipt of assistance shall be credited toward the 51% of project costs to be provided by sources of funding other than a secured loan.</p> <p>(Sec. 7303) A Water Infrastructure Investment Trust Fund is established to make funds available for the EPA to make capitalization grants for clean water and safe drinking water state revolving funds. The trust fund is to be funded by fees for labels to be provided by the Department of the Treasury that are designed for placement on products to inform consumers that the manufacturer, producer, or importer of the product participates in such trust fund and is contributing to the clean water of the United States.</p> <p>The EPA must report on: (1) the affordability gap faced by low-income populations located in urban and rural areas in obtaining services from clean water and drinking water systems; and (2) options for programs to provide incentives for rate adjustments at the local level to achieve "full cost" or "true value" pricing for such services, while protecting low-income ratepayers from undue burden.</p> <p>(Sec. 7304) The EPA must carry out a grant program to accelerate the development of innovative water technologies that address pressing water challenges. Priority must be given to projects that have the potential to: (1) provide substantial cost savings across a sector, (2) significantly improve human health or the environment, or (3) provide additional water supplies with minimal environmental impact.</p> <p>(Sec. 7305) The Water Resources Research Act of 1984 is amended to: (1) declare that additional research is required to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of new and existing treatment works through alternative approaches, including nonstructural alternatives, decentralization, water use efficiency and conservation, and actions to reduce energy consumption or extract energy from wastewater; (2) require each water resources research and technology institute to arrange for research that expands understanding of water resources (currently, of water-related phenomena); (3) direct Interior to report annually on each institute's compliance with matching fund requirements and provisions permitting the use of funds only to reimburse direct cost expenditures incurred for the conduct of the water resources research program; and (4) authorize appropriations for such institutes through FY2021.</p> <p>(Sec. 7306) The Water Desalination Act of 1996 is reauthorized through FY2021, with a list of funding priorities. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy must develop a strategic plan that coordinates agencies involved in desalination, strengthens cooperation with international partners, and establishes priorities for future federal investments.</p> <p>(Sec. 7307) The EPA must develop nonregulatory national drought resilience guidelines and provide recommendations for a period of 10 years regarding drought preparedness planning and investments for communities, water utilities, and other water users and providers.</p> <p>(Sec. 7308) A state may provide additional subsidization (including forgiveness of certain principal or negative interest loans) to encourage the use of innovative water technologies when the state provides: (1) financial assistance from a state water pollution control revolving fund to municipalities or intermunicipal, interstate, or state agencies; or (2) loans under a state drinking water treatment revolving loan fund. The EPA may provide technical assistance to facilitate financial assistance for such technologies.</p> <p>Subtitle D--Drinking Water Disaster Relief and Infrastructure Investments</p> <p>(Sec. 7401) This subtitle makes additional funding available to the EPA to provide: (1) capitalization grants under the drinking water state revolving fund program to states for which the President has declared an emergency for public health threats associated with lead or other contaminants in a public drinking water supply system, and (2) secured loans under WIFIA to states with such a presidentially-declared emergency and other entities eligible to receive WIFIA loans for water infrastructure projects.</p> <p>Under the process in the Safe Drinking Water Act for assisting disadvantaged communities, states may provide additional subsidization to public drinking water supply systems that have been the subject of such an emergency declaration.</p> <p>States with emergencies related to drinking water contaminants may use such assistance to repair and replace public and private drinking water infrastructure. </p> <p>Any of the additional funding provided by this section for the drinking water state revolving fund program that is not obligated within 18 months after availability to address an emergency declaration shall be available for allotment to the drinking water revolving funds of all states. <p>Upon the request of a state or local health official, the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry of the National Center for Environmental Health must conduct voluntary surveillance activities to evaluate any adverse health effects on individuals exposed to lead in affected communities. <p>(Sec. 7402) If a federal or state emergency declaration has been issued due to a threat to public health from heightened exposure to lead in a municipal drinking water supply, states may use FY2016 funds appropriated for clean water and drinking water state revolving fund capitalization grants to provide additional subsidies to eligible recipients in the form of forgiveness of principal, negative interest loans, or grants as initial financing to restructure debt obligations even if: (1) the debt was incurred before enactment of the FY2016 appropriations (currently, the debt must have been incurred on or after the FY2016 appropriations); or (2) the subsidies exceed the 20% cap on the use of drinking water state revolving fund capitalization grants to provide additional subsidies.</p> <p>(Sec. 7403) The Department of Health and Human Services must establish: (1) a lead exposure registry to collect data on the lead exposure of residents of a city exposed to lead contamination in the local drinking water system; and (2) an advisory committee to review federal lead exposure programs and identify health care, education, and nutrition services for individuals affected by lead exposure.</p> <p>(Sec. 7404) Additional funding is provided to: (1) the&nbsp;CDC for the childhood lead poisoning prevention program, (2) the Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Healthy Homes Initiative, and (3) the Health Resources and Services Administration for the Healthy Start Initiative.</p> <p>(Sec. 7405) The Department of Justice and the EPA inspector general must report on the status of any ongoing investigations into the federal and state response to the contamination of the drinking water supply of Flint, Michigan. After the investigations are completed, the GAO must review issues not addressed by the investigations and make recommendations to prevent similar situations in the future.</p> <p>Subtitle E--Report on Groundwater Contamination</p> <p>(Sec. 7501) The Navy must submit, annually: (1) a report on groundwater contamination at 830 South Oyster Bay Road, Bethpage, New York; and (2) a comprehensive strategy to prevent the site from contaminating drinking water wells.</p> <p>Subtitle F--Restoration</p> <p>Part I--Great Lakes Restoration Initiative</p> <p>(Sec. 7611) This part amends the Clean Water Act to authorize the EPA's Great Lakes Restoration Initiative for FY2017-FY2021. </p> <p>Under a five-year action plan, the Initiative must prioritize and carry out programs and projects for Great Lakes protection and restoration, including: (1) the remediation of toxic substances and areas of concern, (2) the prevention and control of invasive species and their impacts, (3) the protection and restoration of near-shore health and the prevention and mitigation of nonpoint source pollution, and (4) habitat and wildlife protection and restoration. </p> <p>Funding made available to implement the Initiative may not be used for any water infrastructure activity (other than a green infrastructure project that improves habitat and other ecosystem functions in the Great Lakes) for which funding is made available under the clean water or drinking water state revolving fund program. Federal agencies must: (1) maintain the base level of funding for their Great Lakes activities without regard to funding under the Initiative, and (2) identify new activities to support the environmental goals of the Initiative and the Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement. </p> <p>Part II--Lake Tahoe Restoration</p> <p>This part revises and reauthorizes the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act for 10 fiscal years after the bill's enactment. </p> <p>(Sec. 7621) The part amends the findings and purposes of the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act to include relevant findings since its enactment in 2000, including references to the 2011 and 2012 Lake Tahoe Forums and updated levels of support provided by public and private entities to the Lake Tahoe Basin since 1997. </p> <p>(Sec. 7622) The part adds definitions, including &quot;Environmental Improvement Program&quot; as the program adopted by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and &quot;forest management activity&quot; to mean: (1) prescribed burning for ecosystem health and hazardous fuels reduction, (2) mechanical and minimum tool treatment, (3) stream environment zone restoration and other watershed and wildlife habitat enhancements, and (4) other activities consistent with practices of the U.S. Forest Service of the USDA. </p> <p>(Sec. 7623) The part adds additional requirements for the management of the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit, including by requiring the Forest Service to: </p> <ul> <li>coordinate with the EPA and state, local, and private entities, including local fire departments and volunteer groups; </li> <li>conduct forest management activities in the Basin in a manner that helps achieve and maintain the environmental threshold carrying capacities established by the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and that attains multiple ecosystem benefits, unless such activities would excessively increase the cost of a program; and </li> <li>establish and monitor post-program ground condition criteria for ground disturbance caused by forest management activities. </li> </ul> <p>Subject to valid existing rights, the federal land located in the Basin is withdrawn from: (1) all forms of entry, appropriation, or disposal under the public land laws; (2) location, entry, and patent under the mining laws; and (3) disposition under all laws relating to mineral and geothermal leasing.
