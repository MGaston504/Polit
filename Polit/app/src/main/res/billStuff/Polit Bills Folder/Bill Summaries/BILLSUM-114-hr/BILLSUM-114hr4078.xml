<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Give States a Chance Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill authorizes the governor of any state in which it is proposed to place or resettle as a refugee an alien meeting certain criteria to refuse such placement or resettlement if the governor: </p> <ul> <li>has not properly been informed of the intended sponsorship process for the refugee, </li> <li>has determined that the proposed location for the refugee within the state is inappropriate because the proportion of refugees and comparable entrants in that location's population is too high, or </li> <li>is not reasonably satisfied that the refugee does not post a security threat. </li> </ul> <p>A covered refugee may not be admitted to the United States until the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) certifies to Congress that he or she is not a U.S. security threat. </p> <p>A &quot;covered refugee&quot; is any alien applying for U.S. refugee admission who: </p> <ul> <li>is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria, </li> <li>has no nationality and whose last habitual residence was in Iraq or Syria, or </li> <li>has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after March 1, 2011. </li> </ul> <p>The Inspector General of DHS shall review 20% of all certifications made each fiscal year. </p> <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) shall ensure that each covered refugee receives a thorough background investigation before admission. A covered refugee may not be admitted until the FBI certifies that such an investigation has been done.</p>]]></summary-text>
