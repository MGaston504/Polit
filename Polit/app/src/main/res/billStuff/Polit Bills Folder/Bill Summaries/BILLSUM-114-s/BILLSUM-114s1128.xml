<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Early Pell Promise Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to authorize the Department of Education to carry out a program of grants to state educational agencies (SEAs) under which a student who is in eighth grade and is eligible for a free or reduced price lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act may be provided a commitment to receive a Federal Pell Grant early in the student's academic career.</p> <p>Pursuant to such a commitment, the student receives a Pell Grant during the first two years of attendance at an institution of higher education (IHE) as an undergraduate if the student:</p> <ul> <li>files the FAFSA form during the senior year of secondary school and the succeeding year, and</li> <li>enrolls at the IHE not later than three years after receiving a secondary school diploma or after release from the Armed Forces.</li> </ul> <p>A student may not receive the early Pell Grant for a succeeding year if the expected family contribution for either year is more than twice the threshold amount for Pell Grant eligibility for that year.</p> <p>Funds are reserved for an independent evaluation of the program's impact.</p> <p>In order to participate in the program, an SEA must develop a targeted information campaign and include in the plan for that campaign cost data disaggregated by institution type and information on both state and federal financial aid. </p>]]></summary-text>
