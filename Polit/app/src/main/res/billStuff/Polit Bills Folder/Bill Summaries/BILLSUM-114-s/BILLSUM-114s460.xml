<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Drinking Water Protection Act </b></p> <p>This bill amends the Safe Drinking Water Act to direct the Environmental Protection Agency to develop and submit to Congress a strategic plan for assessing and managing risks associated with algal toxins in drinking water provided by public water systems. Cyanobacteria, also known as blue-green algae, have the ability to produce cyanotoxins, or algal toxins. When certain conditions are favorable, algae can rapidly multiply causing blooms, or dense surface scums, that may be toxic. </p> <p>The plan must include steps and time lines to:</p> <ul> <li>evaluate the risk to human health from drinking water contaminated with algal toxins;</li> <li> establish, publish, and update a comprehensive list of algal toxins that may have an adverse effect on human health;</li> <li> summarize the known adverse human health effects of algal toxins and the factors that cause toxin-producing cyanobacteria and algae to grow rapidly and make toxins; </li> <li>determine whether to publish health advisories for algal toxins and establish relevant guidance; </li> <li>recommend feasible treatment options; and </li> <li>enter into cooperative agreements with, and provide technical assistance to, affected states and public water systems to manage risks associated with algal toxins. </li> </ul> <ul> </ul>]]></summary-text>
