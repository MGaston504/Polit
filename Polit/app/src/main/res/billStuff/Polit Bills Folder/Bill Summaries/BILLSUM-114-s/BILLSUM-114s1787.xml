<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Full-Service Community Schools Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to establish a full-service community schools grant program. A &ldquo;full-service community school&rdquo; is a public elementary or secondary school that participates in a community-based effort to coordinate, integrate, and provide year-round access to educational, developmental, family, health, and other comprehensive services for students, families, and the community. </p> <p>ED must require each grant recipient to provide matching funds based on a sliding scale that accounts for the grantee&rsquo;s ability to obtain matching funds and the relative poverty of the grantee&rsquo;s targeted population. However, ED may not consider an applicant&rsquo;s ability to match funds when determining which applicants will be awarded grants under the program. The duration of each renewable grant is five years.</p> <p>With respect to program guidance, the bill also establishes principles of effectiveness as well as a Full-Service Community Schools Advisory Committee.</p>]]></summary-text>
