<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Information Reporting Simplification Act of 2015 </strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to penalties for filing erroneous tax returns, to set forth a safe harbor rule for errors on tax information returns and payee statements. If any such return or statement has one or more incorrect dollar amounts, but no single amount in error differs from the correct amount by more than $100, and no single amount reported for tax withheld on any information return differs from the correct amount by more than $25, then no correction shall be required and such return or statement shall be treated as having been filed with all of the correct required information. </p>]]></summary-text>
