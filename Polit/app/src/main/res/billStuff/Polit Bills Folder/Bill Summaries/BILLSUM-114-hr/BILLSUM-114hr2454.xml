<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>Requires the Department of Justice (DOJ) to publicly disclose, in a&nbsp;manner consistent with national security,&nbsp;any decision of a court established by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 (FISA) that surveillance activities conducted by the U.S. government have violated a particular U.S. law or constitutional provision.</p> <p>Requires the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to provide information on surveillance activities to Congress, including information regarding: (1) whether the National Security Agency (NSA) or any other element of the intelligence community has ever collected, or made plans to collect, the cell-site location information of a large number of U.S. persons with no known connection to suspicious activity; (2) the type and amount of evidence the DNI believes is required to permit the collection&nbsp;of cell-site information for intelligence purposes; (3) whether NSA or any other element of the intelligence community has ever conducted a warrantless search of a collection of communications in an effort to <em></em>find the communications of a particular U.S. person (other than a corporation) and, if so, the number of such searches or an estimate of such number; (4) when the U.S. government first began relying on authorities under FISA to justify the collection of records with no known connection to suspicious activity; (5) whether representations made by DOJ to the Supreme Court in the case of <em>Clapper v. Amnesty International USA</em> accurately described the use of authorities under FISA by the government, which of such representations, if any, were inaccurate, and how such representations have been corrected; and (6) FISA court opinions that identified violations of the law, the Constitution, or FISA court orders relating to the collection of information under FISA.</p> <p>Directs the Government Accountability Office, in consultation with the U.S. International Trade Commission, to conduct an assessment of the economic impact, including the impact on the ability of U.S. communication service providers to compete in foreign markets, of bulk collection and surveillance programs conducted under FISA, and to report to Congress on such assessment. </p>]]></summary-text>
