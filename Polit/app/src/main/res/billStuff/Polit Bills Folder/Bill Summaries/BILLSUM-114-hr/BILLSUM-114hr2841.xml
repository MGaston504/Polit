<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Fair Access for Safe and Timely Generics Act of 2015 or the FAST Generics Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to prohibit the license holder of a Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug or biological product from restricting availability of the medication for testing by a product developer seeking to develop a drug, generic drug, or biosimilar, including restricting availability with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS).</p> <p>Upon request, the license holder of a medication that is not subject to a REMS must provide a product developer with the medication for testing.</p> <p>For a medication subject to a REMS, a product developer must have FDA authorization to obtain the medication before the license holder must provide it. The FDA may authorize a product developer to conduct testing and clinical trials with the medication.</p> A wholesaler or specialty distributor who receives a request from a product developer for a medication for testing may not disclose to the license holder the identity of the product developer. <p>The FDA may prohibit or limit transfer of a medication to a product developer if the transfer poses an imminent hazard to public health.</p> <p>License holders are not liable for claims arising from a product developer testing the medication.</p> <p>The FDA may waive the requirement that a drug use a single, shared system of elements to assure safe use with a comparable approved drug if the product developer is unable to finalize terms for a shared system with the license holder of the approved drug.</p>]]></summary-text>
