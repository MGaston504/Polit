<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Justice for Telecommunications Consumers Act</b></p> <p>This bill prohibits a predispute arbitration agreement from being valid or enforceable if it requires arbitration of a dispute arising out of a contract for commercial mobile services, multichannel video programming distributor services, telecommunications or information services, or common carrier services under the Communications Act of 1934.</p> <p>The validity or enforceability of such an agreement to arbitrate shall be determined by a court, under federal law, rather than by an arbitrator, irrespective of whether the party resisting arbitration challenges the arbitration agreement specifically or in conjunction with other terms of the contract containing such agreement.</p> <p>The bill does not apply to contracts between an employer and a labor organization or between labor organizations, except that no such arbitration provision shall waive the right of an employee to seek judicial enforcement of a right arising under the U.S. Constitution, a state constitution, a federal or state statute, or related public policy.</p>]]></summary-text>
