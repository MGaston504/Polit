<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Workforce Health Improvement Program Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to modify the tax exclusion of the value of on-premises employer-provided athletic facilities. The bill provides for an exclusion from the gross income of an employee for: (1) the value of any on-premises employer-provided athletic facility; and (2) so much of the fess, dues, or other membership expenses paid by an employer on behalf of an employee, but not exceeding $900 per employee per year. The bill sets forth an expanded definition of &quot;athletic or fitness facility,&quot; which specifies that the health or fitness component of such a facility cannot be incidental to its overall function and purpose.</p> <p>The bill also allows an employer to claim a tax deduction for the fees, dues, or membership expenses paid to an athletic or fitness facility on behalf of an employee. </p>]]></summary-text>
