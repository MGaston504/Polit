<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Ban Poisonous Additives Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill bans food containers composed, in whole or in part, of bisphenol A (BPA). </p> <p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may grant waivers to a facility for a particular product if the facility: (1) demonstrates that it is not technologically feasible to replace BPA in the container or to use a BPA-free container, and (2) submits to the FDA a plan and time line for removing BPA from the container. Products granted a waiver must include a warning on the label.</p> <p>The FDA must promote and facilitate the use of BPA replacements. BPA may not be replaced with substances that: (1) are known or likely human carcinogens; (2) have been found by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to be persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic; (3) cause reproductive or developmental toxicity; or (4) are endocrine disrupting chemicals.</p> <p>The FDA must review substances that may be found in food, including food additives and food contact substances, and take remedial action if it does not determine that there is a reasonable certainty that no harm will result from aggregate exposure, taking into consideration potential adverse effects from low-dose exposure and the effects on vulnerable populations and populations with high exposure. </p> This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the manufacturer or supplier of a food contact substance to notify the FDA of the identity and intended use of the substance prior to its introduction into interstate commerce and that: (1) no adverse health effects result from low-dose exposures to the substance, and (2) the substance has not been shown to cause reproductive or developmental toxicity in humans or animals.]]></summary-text>
