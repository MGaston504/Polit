<summary-text><![CDATA[<p> This bill restores a 10-year statute of limitations for the collection of debts by administrative offset. An administrative offset is the withholding of funds payable by or held by the United States to satisfy a debt, and this bill prohibits the procedure from being used for claims that have been outstanding for more than 10 years. </p> <p>The bill prohibits the Social Security Administration from seeking an administrative offset for collection of a debt or claim arising out of a Social Security benefit payment from a beneficiary's child who is without fault or from an individual who was under the age of 18 when the debt or claim arose. </p>]]></summary-text>
