(Thus, bars certain contract provisions that prohibit consumers from commenting publicly about businesses.)</p> <p>Sets forth exceptions under which a provision shall not be considered void under this Act if the provision prohibits disclosure of certain: (1) trade secrets or commercial or financial information, (2) personnel and medical files, or (3) law enforcement records. </p> <p>Provides for this Act to be inapplicable to contracts establishing an employer-employee or independent contractor relationship.</p> <p>Prohibits businesses from offering or entering into form contracts containing a provision that is considered void under this Act.
