<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>No Subsidies Without Verification Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill disallows the health plan premium assistance tax credit or cost-sharing reduction under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act before an individual's eligibility and the accurate amount of the credit or reduction is verified. Verification requires a review of the information provided by an applicant and resolution of any inconsistency between the information and the records of the Departments of the Treasury or Homeland Security or the Social Security Administration.</p> <p>Individuals are exempt from the penalty for not maintaining minimum essential coverage for any month for which a premium tax credit is being claimed and that begins before verification is completed.</p> <p>The premium tax credit and reduced cost-sharing are suspended for an individual for whom a subsidy was allowed before enactment of this Act until the individual's eligibility is verified. A special enrollment period is provided for an individual who terminated enrollment in a qualified plan during the period of suspension.</p>]]></summary-text>
