<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used in the Senate to determine the budgetary impact for evaluating budget points of order. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This bill prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation. </p>]]></summary-text>
