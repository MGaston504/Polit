<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Reducing Tax Preparation Burdens for American Investments and Repairs Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of the Treasury to amend Treasury regulations relating to the election of a taxpayer to expense in the current taxable year certain depreciable business assets that would otherwise be capitalized and depreciated over a period of time. Current regulations provide for a safe harbor rule that allows expensing of such assets that do not exceed $500 per invoice for taxpayers without applicable financial statements. This bill would increase the safe harbor threshold to $2,500 per invoice for such taxpayers for taxable years beginning after 2015. </p>]]></summary-text>
