review process for the project, projects, or program, but only to support activities that directly and meaningfully contribute to expediting and improving permitting and review processes.</p> <p>(Sec. 1313) Directs DOT, in coordination with federal agencies likely to have substantive review or approval responsibilities under federal law, to develop a coordinated and concurrent environmental review and permitting process for transportation projects, meeting specified criteria, when initiating an environmental impact statement. </p> <p>(Sec. 1314) Amends MAP-21 to require inflation adjustments to specified dollar amounts indicating the maximum federal assistance to certain federal-aid highway projects which must be categorically excluded from the requirements relating to environmental assessments or environmental impact statements.</p> <p>(Sec. 1315) Directs DOT to develop a template programmatic agreement with states that provides for efficient procedures for evaluating categorical exclusion determinations.</p> <p>(Sec. 1316) Directs DOT to:</p> <ul> <li>allow states to assume DOT responsibilities for project design, plans, specifications, estimates, contract awards, and inspection of projects, on both a project-specific and programmatic basis; and</li> <li>recommend to Congress legislation to permit the assumption of additional authorities by states, including about real estate acquisition and project design.</li> </ul> <p>(Sec. 1317) Directs DOT to examine ways to modernize and improve the NEPA environmental review process for federal-aid highway

environmental review and permitting process.</p> <p>Subtitle D--Miscellaneous </p> <p>(Sec. 1401) Prohibits, through FY2020, the use of a state's apportionment of highway safety improvement program funds to purchase, operate, or maintain an automated traffic enforcement system, except any located in school zones.</p> <p>Defines "automated traffic enforcement system" to mean any camera that captures an image of a vehicle for purposes of traffic law enforcement.</p> <p>(Sec. 1402) Requires DOT to compile and make available on the DOT public website any data on the amounts of federal-aid highway program funds made available under this title for each fiscal year.</p> <p>(Sec. 1403) Requires DOT to make available certain additional funds deposited into the HTF Highway Account or Mass Transit Account for federal-aid highway programs.</p> <p>Reauthorizes appropriations through FY2020.</p> <p>(Sec. 1404) Requires a design for new construction or rehabilitation of NHS highways to take into account, in addition to other specified criteria, the environment and safety for other modes of transportation, as well as cost savings by utilizing flexibility in current design guidance and regulations.</p> <p>(Sec. 1405) Requires any requested or required justification report for a project that would add a point of access to, or exit from, the Interstate System to include new or modified freeway-to-crossroad interchanges inside a transportation management area.</p> <p>(Sec. 1407) Makes eligible for funding under the National Highway Performance Program and the Surface
