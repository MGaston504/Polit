<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Promoting Life-Saving New Therapies for Neonates Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to award the sponsor of a new drug or biological product for the treatment of newborns a neonatal drug exclusivity voucher upon approval of the medication. A neonatal drug exclusivity voucher is a transferable voucher for a one-year extension of all existing patents and marketing exclusivities for a brand name medication. For a sponsor to be eligible for a voucher, the new medication must: (1) treat a condition identified in the Priority List of Critical Needs for Neonates required under this bill, and (2) have been studied in newborns.</p> <p>A voucher may be revoked if the new medication is not marketed in the United States within one year of approval.</p> <p>A voucher may not be used: (1) to extend the marketing exclusivity period for a drug for which the FDA requires an assessment of the safety and effectiveness in newborns, or (2) on the same product as a priority review voucher.</p> <p>A sponsor intending to use a voucher must notify the FDA at least 15 months before the expiration of the patents or exclusivity to be extended.</p> The Government Accountability Office must study the effectiveness of this voucher program.]]></summary-text>
