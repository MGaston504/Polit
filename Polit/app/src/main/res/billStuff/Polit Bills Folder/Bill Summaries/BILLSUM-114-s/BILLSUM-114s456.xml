<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Cyber Threat Sharing Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>Amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to permit private entities to: (1) disclose lawfully obtained cyber threat indicators to a private information sharing and analysis organization and the national cybersecurity and communications integration center (NCCIC); and (2) receive indicators disclosed by private entities, the federal government, or state or local governments.</p> <p>Permits any entity to disclose lawfully obtained indicators to a federal entity for investigative purposes consistent with the lawful authorities of the federal entity.</p> <p>Restricts private entities' use, retention, or further disclosure of cyber threat indicators to purposes relating to information system protection, cyber threat identification or mitigation, or crime reporting.</p> <p>Directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to select through a competitive process a private entity to identify best practices for private information sharing and analysis organizations.</p> <p>Provides liability protections to entities that voluntarily share lawfully obtained indicators with: (1) the NCCIC, or (2) a private information sharing and analysis organization if the organization self-certifies that it has adopted the best practices identified by the DHS-selected private entity.</p> <p>Directs DHS to: (1) designate the NCCIC to receive and disclose threat indicators to federal and nonfederal entities in as close to real time as practicable, and (2) develop a program to support implementation of automated mechanisms for real time sharing.</p> <p>Prohibits a federal entity from using a disclosed indicator as evidence in a regulatory enforcement action against the entity that disclosed the indicator, but allows a federal entity to use disclosed indicators for regulatory enforcement if the information is received by other lawful means.</p> <p>Requires DHS to develop policies for federal entities to:</p> <ul> <li> anonymize and destroy information in a timely manner to limit the acquisition, interception, retention, use, and disclosure of indicators that are likely to identify specific persons;</li> <li> limit reception, use, and retention only to protect information systems or to investigate, prosecute, or otherwise respond to computer crimes, threats of death or serious bodily harm, serious threats to a minor, or attempts or conspiracies to commit such offenses;</li> <li> preserve confidentiality of proprietary information; and</li> <li> penalize federal employees who violate these policies. </li> </ul> <p>Repeals threat indicator sharing procedures established by this Act five years after enactment of this Act.</p> <p>Expresses the sense of Congress that the statement issued by the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission on April 10, 2014, entitled &quot;Antitrust Policy Statement On Sharing Of Cybersecurity Information&quot; provides protections against antitrust concerns for the legitimate sharing of cyber threat indicators. </p>]]></summary-text>
