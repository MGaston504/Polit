<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Constitutional Amendment </b></p> <p>This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total outlays for a fiscal year from exceeding total receipts for that fiscal year unless Congress authorizes the excess by a three-fifths roll call vote of each chamber. </p> <p>The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal, receipts derived from borrowing, and receipts or outlays of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds. </p> <p>The resolution requires the President to annually submit to Congress a budget in which total outlays do not exceed total receipts. </p> <p>The balanced budget requirement does not apply if: </p> <ul> <li> a declaration of war is in effect or if the United States is engaged in military conflict which causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security, or </li> <li>during the fiscal year or preceding fiscal year, the U.S. economy grew by less than 0% in real gross domestic product during two or more consecutive quarters or the unemployment rate was more than 7% during two or more consecutive months. </li> </ul> <p>The resolution prohibits a court from enforcing the requirements by ordering cuts to Social Security or Medicare payments unless the funds available to the trust fund for a program are not sufficient to cover the outlays that would occur during the year if the fund were fully solvent. </p>]]></summary-text>
