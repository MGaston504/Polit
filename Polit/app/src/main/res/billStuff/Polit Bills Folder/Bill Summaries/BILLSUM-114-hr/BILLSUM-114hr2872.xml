<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Opioid Addiction Treatment Modernization Act</b></p> <p> This bill amends the Controlled Substances Act to require a practitioner who administers or dispenses narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an opioid treatment program to complete training every two years. </p> <p> The legislation revises the waiver requirements for a physician who wants to administer, dispense, or prescribe narcotic drugs for maintenance or detoxification treatment in an office-based opioid treatment program. Currently, such physician must notify the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and certify that he or she is a qualifying physician, has the capacity to refer patients for appropriate counseling and ancillary services, and will comply with a patient limit. This bill requires a physician to also certify that he or she maintains a diversion control plan and has the capacity to provide directly or by referral all drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of opioid addiction. </p> <p> The bill modifies the definition of a "qualifying physician." Currently, a qualifying physician must be licensed in a state and have expertise (such as relevant certification, training, or experience). This legislation requires a qualifying physician to also complete training every two years and obtain written consent from each patient regarding available treatment options.&nbsp; </p> <p> It permits HHS or the Department of Justice to inspect registered practitioners who dispense narcotics to ensure compliance with the requirements of this Act.</p> <p> All practitioners who are permitted to dispense narcotic drugs to individuals for maintenance treatment or detoxification treatment must submit to HHS a certification of compliance with the requirements of this Act.</p> <p> The Government Accountability Office must review opioid addition treatment services in the United States and report findings to Congress every five years. </p>]]></summary-text>
