<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Homeless and Foster Youth Achievement Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 to require a state to include additional information&nbsp;in its annual state report card.&nbsp; </p> <p>Under current law, a state must&nbsp;include&nbsp;data regarding student achievement&nbsp;on state academic assessments,&nbsp;both in the aggregate and disaggregated by race, ethnicity, disability status, migrant status, English proficiency, and status as&nbsp;disadvantaged.&nbsp; For purposes of a state's annual report card, the bill expands those categories to include homeless status and status as a child in foster care. Graduation rates for secondary school students must be reported by the same categories by which student achievement data is reported.</p>]]></summary-text>
