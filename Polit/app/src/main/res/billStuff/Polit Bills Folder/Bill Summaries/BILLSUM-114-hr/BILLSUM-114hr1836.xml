<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Monuments Protection Act</b> </p> <p>Directs the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture to enter into an agreement with a state, the District of Columbia, a federally recognized Indian tribe, a U.S. territory or possession, or a political subdivision of such an entity that offers to assume activities to resume or continue operations and public access to any covered unit during any period when those activities would not otherwise be carried out because: (1) there is a lapse in available federal funds as a result of a failure to enact a regular appropriations bill or continuing resolution, or (2) there are insufficient federal funds to operate such unit as a result of a failure of the federal government to make sufficient funds available. </p> <p>Defines a &quot;covered unit&quot; to mean:</p> <ul> <li>public lands,</li> <li>units of the National Park System,</li> <li>units of the National Wildlife Refuge System,</li> <li>federally owned open air monuments and memorials,</li> <li>units of the National Forest System, and </li> <li>federally owned roads and off ramps on all such lands. </li> </ul> <p>Requires Interior and USDA to reimburse such an entity once funds are made available for activities carried out by such entity.</p>]]></summary-text>
