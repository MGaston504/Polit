<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Obamacare Marriage Penalty Elimination Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code, with respect to the tax credit for health care insurance premium assistance, to: (1) calculate the amount of such credit in the case of a joint tax return as the sum of each credit amount allowed to each spouse, thus&nbsp;preventing the tax effect known as the marriage penalty; and (2) replace the 400% poverty line eligibility limit for such credit with an applicable percentage based on a calculation of the combination of increased tax revenues and decreased outlays resulting from this Act. </p>]]></summary-text>
