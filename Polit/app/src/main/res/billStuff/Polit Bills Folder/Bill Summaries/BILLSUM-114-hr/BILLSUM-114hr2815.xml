<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Assuring Quality Outcomes in Higher Education Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill requires the Department of Education (ED) to conduct and publish an impact analysis prior to implementing any final rule or enforcing any existing regulation or framework that utilizes income- or employment-based metrics. The Government Accountability Office must review the impact analysis for accuracy and completeness. </p> <p>ED's impact analysis must include the effect of income- or employment-based metrics on all postsecondary education programs and students at all categories of institutions of higher education that participate in a title IV program under the Higher Education Act of 1965, the correlation between variables other than quality of education that could affect income and debt-to-income ratios or employment outcome, and the comparison of various income sources and debt data utilized under the regulation or performance framework. </p> <p>The requirement established by this Act terminates when a law is enacted that reauthorizes the Higher Education Act of 1965 for at least two fiscal years. </p> <div> </div>]]></summary-text>
