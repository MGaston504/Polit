<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill requires Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) appropriations to be paid for with revenues. FY2015 OCO funds must not be used during a period beginning 90 days after enactment of this bill and ending upon enactment of a law increasing revenues by at least the amount of the OCO appropriation. The bill also amends the Rules of the House of Representatives to create a point of order against legislation increasing funding for OCO for any fiscal year unless a provision increasing revenues by at least the same amount is included. Under current law, OCO funding is exempt from discretionary spending limits and other budget enforcement rules. </p>]]></summary-text>
