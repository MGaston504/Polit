The Office shall terminate any grant for failure of compliance with a plan of action.</p> <p>The bill prescribes requirements for applications for new and continuation grants, their review and selection, as well as public notice for grant opportunities.</p> <p>(Sec. 204) Upon request by an eligible entity, the SBA may waive, in whole or in part, although not for more than two years, the requirement to obtain non-federal funds for a grant recipient's counseling and training activities.</p> <p> TITLE III--SCORE PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION</p> <p><i>SCORE for Small Business Act of 2015</i></p> <p> (Sec. 302) This bill amends the Small Business Act to reauthorize the SCORE program (Service Corps of Retired Executives) for FY2017-FY2018.</p> <p>(Sec. 303) The bill renames the Service Corps of Retired Executives Association program as simply the SCORE program.</p> <p>The SBA shall award a grant to the SCORE Association (or any successor group) to manage the SCORE program.</p> <p>Based on business experience and knowledge, a volunteer participating in the SCORE program shall:</p> <ul> <li>provide at no cost to individuals who own, or aspire to own, small business concerns personal counseling, mentoring, and coaching relating to the process of starting, expanding, managing, buying, and selling a business; and</li> <li>facilitate low-cost education workshops for individuals who own, or aspire to own, small business concerns.</li> </ul> <p>The SBA shall ensure that the SCORE program and each of its chapters develop and implement plans and goals to provide services more effectively and efficiently to individuals in rural areas, economically disadvantaged communities, and other traditionally underserved communities, including plans for electronic initiatives, web-based initiatives, chapter expansion, partnerships, and the development of new skills by participating volunteers.</p> <p>The bill prescribes general privacy requirements for the disclosure of information of businesses assisted under such program.</p> <p>(Sec. 304) The SCORE Association shall:</p> <ul> <li>make use of online counseling, including by webinars and an electronic mentoring platform; </li> <li>study the future role of the SCORE program; and</li> <li>develop a strategic plan for how the program will evolve to meet the needs of America's entrepreneurs over the next five years.</li> </ul>]]></summary-text>
