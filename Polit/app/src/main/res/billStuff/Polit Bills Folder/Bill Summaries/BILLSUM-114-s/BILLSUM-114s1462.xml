<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Eliminating Dangerous Oil Cars and Ensuring Community Safety Act</b></p> <p>This bill replaces general requirements for design standards of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) for pressurized tank cars with a retrofitting requirement for certain tank cars.</p> <p>No rail carrier may ship on or after a specified deadline any hazardous material (hazmat) in any tank car under DOT-111 (Department of Transportation specification for a non-pressurized rail tank car) or non-jacketed Casualty Prevention Circular (CPC)-1232 (new rail tank car standards for transporting crude oil or ethanol), unless the tank car has been retrofitted in accordance with the DOT-117 specification design established by the May 2015 final rule for the safe transportation of flammable liquids by rail.</p> <p>DOT shall establish and begin enforcing a national maximum volatility standard for the transport of crude oil by rail or by barge.</p> <p>The bill sets a maximum speed for any train carrying more than 10 cars, including at least one hazmat-carrying DOT-111 or unjacketed CPC-1232 tank car that has not been so retrofitted, of 40 miles per hour while traveling through a county (or county equivalent) with a population density of greater than 20 persons per square mile.</p> <p> In addition to certain other required track inspections, each rail carrier shall conduct, on main line routes it owns or for which it has been assigned maintenance responsibility, and over which 1 or more high-hazard flammable trains are operated:</p> <ul> <li>2 additional inspections for internal defects of all rail in Classes 3, 4, and 5 for every 40,000,000 gross tons transported on such lines, or annually, whichever interval is shorter; and</li> <li>4 track geometry inspections each calendar year.</li> </ul> <p>Beginning on December 1, 2018, each rail line over which tank cars carrying crude oil or ethanol travel shall be equipped with a positive train control system.</p> <p>Each rail carrier that transports crude oil, petroleum, or other hazardous products by rail shall develop comprehensive oil spill response plans.</p> <p>The FRA shall develop a program to audit such response plans to ensure that they include comprehensive procedures for:</p> <ul> <li>preventing or mitigating a substantial threat of a worst-case discharge of such products resulting from a rail accident or incident, and</li> <li>responding to and cleaning up such a discharge. </li> </ul> <p>The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration shall revise specified spill response planning thresholds to require comprehensive response plans to effectively provide for a carrier's ability to respond to worst-case discharges resulting from accidents involving unit trains or blocks of tank cars transporting oil and petroleum products.</p> <p>Each rail carrier shall:</p> <ul> <li>establish a system through which employees may anonymously report circumstances or incidents that endanger the safety of railroad operations, and </li> <li>provide specified information to the FRA and the county emergency management contact (or equivalent) immediately after the derailment of any high hazard flammable train the carrier operates. </li></ul>]]></summary-text>
