DHS must issue a detainer, take a deportable alien into custody, and initiate removal proceedings upon receiving notice under the interoperable law enforcement and intelligence electronic data system that a deportable alien is in federal, state, or local custody.</p> <p>The Immigration and Nationality Act is further amended to specify that:</p> <ul> <li>in no instance shall the government bear any expense for counsel for any person in removal proceedings or appealing from any such proceedings, </li> <li>an alien's statements must be true more probably than not in order to establish a credible fear of persecution in an asylum interview, and </li> <li>the prerequisite of a bilateral or multilateral agreement is eliminated as a condition for the possible removal to a safe third country in response to an alien's application for asylum in the United States.</li> </ul> <p>DHS must establish quality assurance procedures and take steps to ensure that:</p> <ul> <li>questions by DHS employees exercising expedited removal authority are asked in a uniform manner, and</li> <li>both these questions and the answers are recorded in a uniform fashion.</li> </ul> <p>Department of Justice authority is suspended until January 20, 2017, for waiver of the inadmissibility of any alien unlawfully present in the United States who is the spouse or son or daughter of a U.S. citizen or of a lawful permanent resident alien.</p> <p>Requirements are modified for the temporary protected status of aliens whose return to a foreign country would expose them to a serious threat to their personal safety.</p>]]></summary-text>
