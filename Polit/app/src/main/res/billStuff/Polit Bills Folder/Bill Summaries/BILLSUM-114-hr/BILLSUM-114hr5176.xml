<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Success in Transition for All Veterans Act</strong></p> <p>This bill directs the Department of Labor to carry out a research program to evaluate whether the transition assistance program addresses the differentiated needs, challenges, and post-military service aspirations of women veterans, veterans with disabilities, Native American veterans, veterans who are residents of a U.S. territory, veterans who are part of the indigenous population of a U.S. territory, and other groups of minority veterans. (The transition assistance program is a Labor program that assists members of the armed forces separating from active duty and their spouses in identifying and obtaining employment and training opportunities.)</p> <p>The research program shall address: </p> <ul> <li>whether and how employment barriers and employment aspirations facing such veterans are substantively different from other veteran populations; and </li> <li> whether the transition program is designed to address such differences and, if not, changes that could be made to do so. </li> </ul>]]></summary-text>
