<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Portable Fuel Container Safety Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Consumer Product Safety Commission to promulgate a final rule relating to flame mitigation devices in portable fuel containers for flammable liquid fuels that sufficiently reduces the risk of injuries associated with the tendency of vapors igniting when the container is near an open flame or other ignition source.
