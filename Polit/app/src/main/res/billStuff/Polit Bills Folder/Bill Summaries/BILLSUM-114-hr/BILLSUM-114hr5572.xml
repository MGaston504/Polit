<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Protect Consumers from Phony Phone Charges Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill requires the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to complete a rulemaking proceeding relating to the placing of unauthorized charges on a consumer's telephone bill (commonly referred to as "cramming"). The FCC must consider whether to issue a rule that requires blocking the placement of third-party charges on a consumer's wireline, wireless, or bundled services telephone bill under the criteria it relied upon when it entered into a consent decree relating to cramming with mobile voice and data service providers.</p>]]></summary-text>
