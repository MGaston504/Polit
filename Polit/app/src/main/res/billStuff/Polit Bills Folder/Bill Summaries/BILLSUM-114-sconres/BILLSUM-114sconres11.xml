Under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, reconciliation bills are considered by Congress using expedited legislative procedures that prevent a filibuster and restrict amendments in the Senate.) </p> <p>(Sec. 2001) Includes reconciliation instructions directing the Senate Finance Committee and the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to each submit to the Senate Budget Committee legislation to reduce the deficit by at least $1 billion over the FY2016-FY2025 period.

Applies the point of order to legislation that would cause a net increase in on-budget deficits in excess of $5 billion in any of the 4 consecutive 10-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution. (The existing Senate long-term deficit point of order applies to deficits rather than on-budget deficits.) </p> <p>Exempts Senate legislation for which the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, and limits in this resolution, pursuant to the deficit-neutral reserve fund included in Section 4303(1) for legislation relating to the full repeal of the Affordable Care Act. </p> <p>Establishes a point of order in the House against legislation with a net effect of increasing direct spending by more than $5 billion in any of the four consecutive ten-year periods beginning with the first fiscal year that is 10 years after the budget year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution. </p> <p>Exempts House legislation for which the chairman of the House Budget Committee has made adjustments to the allocations, levels, or limits contained in this concurrent resolution pursuant to sections 4501, 4502, or 4503, which establish deficit-neutral reserve funds for health care legislation, including the repeal of the Affordable Care Act. </p> <p>(Sec. 3102) Provides the appropriations committees with separate allocations for Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on Terrorism and specifies procedures for enforcing and adjusting the allocations. </p> <p>(Sec. 3103) Establishes a point of order restricting the inclusion of certain changes in mandatory programs (CHIMPs) in appropriations legislation for FY2016-FY2019. Limits CHIMPs that reduce budget authority but do not decrease outlays to $19.1 billion for FY2016, $19.1 billion for FY2017, $17 billion for FY2018, and $15 billion for FY2019. </p> <p>(Sec. 3104) Establishes a point of order against full-year FY2016 appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund and exceed $10.8 billion for FY2016. </p> <p>(Sec. 3105) Requires CBO, upon request of the chairman of either the House or Senate Budget Committees to include an estimate of the current actual or estimated market values representing the ''fair value'' of assets and liabilities in estimates for certain federal credit programs under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990. Requires CBO to provide fair-value estimates for legislation related to a housing, residential mortgage, or student loan program. Permits the chairman of the House Budget Committee to use the estimates to determine compliance with the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 and other budget enforcement controls. Permits the Senate to use the estimates only for informational purposes. </p> <p>(Sec. 3106) Provides directions regarding the scoring of legislation relating to a transition from the paper dollar to the dollar coin. </p> <p>(Sec. 3107) Requires CBO to provide estimates of the budgetary effects over FY2016-FY2045 for legislation increasing discretionary spending limits or transferring amounts from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund. (Most CBO estimates are currently provided over a 5- or 10-year period.) </p> <p>(Sec. 3108) Requires CBO to provide projections of federal revenues, outlays, and deficits for the 30-year period beginning with the budget year in its required annual update to the Budget and Economic Outlook. </p> <p>(Sec. 3109) Directs CBO to provide estimates of outlay changes during the second and third decade of enactment of legislation if: (1) either of the budget committee chairs requests the estimate, or (2) the legislation has an outlay impact in excess of 0.25% of the U.S. gross domestic product during the first decade or in the tenth year. </p> <p>(Sec. 3110) Prohibits increases in Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac) guarantee fees from being used to determine budgetary impacts for evaluating budget points of order. (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 3111) Requires CBO to include in deficit projections a one-page statement that: (1) summarizes and categorizes total outlays, receipts, surpluses, and deficits on a unified basis; and (2) includes subtotals for outlays for mandatory and discretionary programs; outlays, payroll tax revenue, and offsetting receipts for Social Security and for Medicare; the surplus or deficit of revenues over outlays for Social Security and Medicare; and revenues. </p> <p>(Sec. 3112) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation. In the Senate, the estimates would be provided for informational purposes only.) </p> <p>Subtitle B--Budget Enforcement in the Senate </p> <p>(Sec. 3201) Extends procedures in the Senate for waivers and appeals of specified budget points of order with a vote of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes) through September 30, 2025. </p> <p>Makes Senate points of order against legislation violating Pay-As-You-Go (PAYGO) rules or increasing the short-term deficit permanent. (The PAYGO point of order prohibits the consideration of legislation that would cause or increase an on-budget deficit over specified time periods. The short-term deficit point of order applies to legislation that would cause a net increase in the deficit in excess of $10 billion in any fiscal year provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution unless it is fully offset over the period of all fiscal years provided for in the most recently adopted budget resolution.) </p> <p>(Sec. 3202) Updates the existing point of order against advanced appropriations to conform to the new budget window. (Under the resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2016 that first becomes available after FY2016, or any new budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for FY2017 that first becomes available after FY2017. The point of order limits advanced appropriations to specified accounts and prohibits total advanced appropriations from exceeding $28.852 billion in new budget authority in each fiscal year). </p> <p>(Sec. 3203) Increases the vote threshold for waiving points of order against legislation with unfunded intergovernmental mandates from a simple majority to three-fifths of Members duly chosen and sworn (currently 60 votes). </p> <p>(Sec. 3204) Repeals the Senate point of order against reconciliation legislation that would increase the deficit or reduce a surplus. </p> <p>(Sec. 3205) Establishes a Senate point of order against voting on passage of legislation unless the CBO cost estimate was available on CBO's website at least 28 hours before the vote. </p> <p>(Sec. 3206) Applies to the Senate a House point of order protecting savings in reconciliation legislation from amendments that increase the deficit.</p> <p>(Sec. 3207) Provides directions to CBO regarding the scoring of certain energy savings contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 3208) Authorizes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust aggregates, allocations, levels, and limits included in this resolution if legislation is enacted that permits adjustments to discretionary spending limits to accommodate wildfire suppression funding. </p> <p>Subtitle C--Budget Enforcement in the House of Representatives </p> <p>(Sec. 3301) Prohibits the House from considering legislation in FY2016 that reduces the actuarial balance of the Social Security trust funds below specified levels. </p> <p>(Sec. 3302) Requires transfers of funds from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund to be counted as new budget authority and outlays in the year the transfer occurs. </p> <p>(Sec. 3303) Authorizes the chairman of the House Budget Committee to adjust committee allocations and levels in this resolution if legislation decreases direct spending in any fiscal year and authorizes appropriations for the same purpose. </p> <p>(Sec. 3304) Prohibits advanced appropriations unless: (1) the appropriation is provided for an account listed as an exception in the report accompanying this resolution, and (2) total advanced appropriations do not exceed $63.271 billion for veterans accounts and $28.852 billion for other accounts in FY2017. (Under this resolution, an advanced appropriation is any new discretionary budget authority provided in appropriations legislation for the fiscal year following FY2016.) </p> <p>(Sec. 3305) Requires the House of Representatives to assess the implementation of section 3207 of this concurrent resolution through a collaborative assessment with the Senate and CBO of the appropriate scorekeeping methodology for energy savings performance contracts. </p> <p>Subtitle D--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 3401) Directs congressional committees to review programs within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work. Directs the committees to include recommendations for improved governmental performance in their annual views and estimates reports submitted to the budget committees. </p> <p>(Sec. 3402) Provides that the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service are reflected in the allocation to the appropriations committees to ensure that the committees retains control over the expenses through the annual appropriations process. Requires the administrative expenses to be included in the cost estimates for appropriations legislation for budget enforcement purposes. </p> <p>(Sec. 3403) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 3404) Permits the chairmen of the budget committees to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. </p> <p>(Sec. 3405) Declares that the provisions in this title are promulgated under the rulemaking powers of the House and Senate with full recognition of the constitutional right of either chamber to change those rules. </p> <p>TITLE IV--RESERVE FUNDS </p> <p>Establishes reserve funds that permit the chairmen of the budget committees to revise the committee allocations, budgetary aggregates, and other levels in the budget resolution to accommodate legislation that meets specified conditions. </p> <p>Subtitle A--Reserve Funds in Both Houses </p> <p>(Sec. 4101) Establishes a deficit-neutral reserve fund for legislation relating to policies and programs to reduce poverty and increase opportunity and upward mobility for struggling Americans, without adversely impacting job creation or increasing the deficit over the FY2106-FY2020 or the FY2016-FY2025 periods. </p> <p>Subtitle B--Reserve Funds in the Senate </p> <p>(Reserve funds in this subtitle provide the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee with flexibility in applying budget enforcement rules to legislation that meets specified criteria.

Reduces the limit in each subsequent fiscal year until FY2021, when no CHIMP that fails to reduce outlays will be permitted in appropriations legislation. </p> <p>(Sec. 407) Establishes a point of order against voting on passage of legislation if no Congressional Budget Office (CBO) cost estimate was made publicly available at least 28 hours before the vote. </p> <p>(Sec. 408) Applies to the Senate a House point of order protecting savings in reconciliation legislation from amendments that increase the deficit. </p> <p>(Sec. 409) Establishes a point of order against a provision designating Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) funds that would cause total OCO funds to exceed $57.997 billion for FY2016 or $59.500 billion for FY2017. </p> <p>(Sec. 410) Establishes a point of order against appropriations legislation that includes changes in mandatory programs that affect the Crime Victims Fund. </p> <p>(Sec. 411) Directs the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, for budget enforcement purposes, to disregard the budgetary effects of timing shifts and rescissions that do not reduce outlays.</p> <p>(Sec. 412) Requires CBO to provide supplemental cost estimates for direct loan and loan guarantee programs by measuring cost on a fair value basis to account for the cost of market risk. </p> <p>(Sec. 413) Directs CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) to provide estimates of the macroeconomic effects of major legislation for informational purposes. (These estimates are frequently referred to as dynamic scoring and include estimates of the budgetary effects from changes in economic output, employment, capital stock, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables resulting from the legislation.) </p> <p>(Sec. 414) Provides directions regarding the scoring of legislation relating to a transition from the paper dollar to the dollar coin. </p> <p>(Sec. 415) Provides directions to CBO regarding the scoring of certain energy savings contracts. </p> <p>(Sec. 416) Requires CBO to provide estimates of the budgetary effects over FY2016-FY2045 for legislation increasing discretionary spending limits or transferring amounts from the general fund of the Treasury to the Highway Trust Fund.

(Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac purchase mortgages and charge the fees to guarantee the payment of principal and interest. This section prevents the fee increases from being used to offset provisions that increase the deficit in determining whether a budget point of order applies to legislation.) </p> <p>Subtitle B--Other Provisions </p> <p>(Sec. 431) Directs Senate committees to review programs and tax expenditures within their jurisdiction to identify waste, fraud, abuse, or duplication and increase the use of performance data to inform committee work. </p> <p>(Sec. 432) Requires the joint explanatory statement accompanying the conference report on the budget resolution to include amounts for the discretionary administrative expenses of the Social Security Administration and the U.S. Postal Service in the allocations to the appropriations committees. </p> <p>(Sec. 433) Sets forth procedures for adjustments of the allocations and aggregates included in the budget resolution. </p> <p>(Sec. 434) Permits the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to adjust levels and allocations in this budget resolution to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. </p> <p>(Sec. 435) Declares that the provisions in this title are promulgated under the Senate's rulemaking power and will be considered part of the rules of the Senate. </p>]]></summary-text>
