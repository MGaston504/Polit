<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to reauthorize the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) through FY2020. SCAAP provides payments to state, local, and tribal governments to offset the costs of incarcerating certain undocumented criminal aliens.</p> <p>It expands the definition of &ldquo;undocumented criminal alien&rdquo; to include an alien who has been charged with a felony or two or more misdemeanors.</p> <p>Additionally, the bill directs the Department of Justice to reimburse a state, local, or tribal government for costs to incarcerate a criminal alien whose immigration status cannot be verified by the Department of Homeland Security. (Currently, a criminal alien with lawful immigration status does not meet the criteria for SCAAP reimbursement.) </p>]]></summary-text>
