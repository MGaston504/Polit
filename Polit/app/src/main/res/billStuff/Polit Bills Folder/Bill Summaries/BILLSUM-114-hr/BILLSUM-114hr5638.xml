<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Solar Fuels Innovation Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Energy Policy Act of 2005 by requiring the Department of Energy (DOE) to carry out the Solar Fuels Basic Research Initiative to expand scientific knowledge about converting solar energy into chemical energy. Specifically, DOE must support research about: (1) replicating natural photosynthetic processes in artificial photosynthesis processes, and (2) generating a variety of fuels produced from sunlight through artificial photosynthesis. (A photosynthetic process is one used by plants to convert light from the sun into chemical energy. Artificial, human-made photosynthesis mimics the natural process.)</p> <p>Appropriations authorized under the bill may not be obligated or expended for commercial application of energy technology.</p> <p>The bill repeals a requirement for DOE to support a research and development program in catalysis science.</p>]]></summary-text>
