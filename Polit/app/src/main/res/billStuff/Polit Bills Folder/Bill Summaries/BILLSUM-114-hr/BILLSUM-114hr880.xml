<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>(Sec. 2) This bill revises and makes permanent after 2014 the research tax credit. The rate of such credit is modified to equal the sum of 20% of so much of the qualified research expenses for the taxable year as exceeds 50% of the average qualified research expenses for the three preceding taxable years, 20% of so much of the basic research payments for the taxable year as exceeds 50% of the average basic research payments for the three preceding taxable years, plus 20% of amounts paid by a business taxpayer to an energy research consortium for energy research. If a taxpayer has no qualified research expenses in any of the three preceding taxable years, the rate of the tax credit is reduced to 10% of current research expenses.</p> <p>The bill also provides that in the case of an eligible small business (i.e., a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded, a partnership, or a sole proprietorship with annual gross receipts not exceeding $50 million in a three-year period), the research credit may offset alternative minimum tax liability.</p> <p>(Sec. 3) The bill prohibits the entry of the budgetary effects of this Act on either PAYCO scorecard under the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of 2010. </p>]]></summary-text>
