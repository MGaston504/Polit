<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Kari's Law Act of 2016</b></p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>This bill amends the Communications Act of 1934 to require multi-line telephone systems to have a default configuration that allows&nbsp;users to directly initiate a call to 9-1-1 (without dialing any additional digit, code, prefix, or post-fix, including any trunk-access code such as the digit "9") from any station equipped with dialing facilities.</p> <p>Businesses installing such systems must configure the&nbsp;systems to provide a notification to a central location at the facility where the system is installed when a person at the facility initiates a call to 9-1-1 using the system, provided that the system is able to be so configured without an improvement to&nbsp;the hardware.</p>]]></summary-text>
