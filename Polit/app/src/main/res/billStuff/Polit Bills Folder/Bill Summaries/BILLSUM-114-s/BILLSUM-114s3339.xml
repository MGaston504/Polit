<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Halt Tax Increases on the Middle Class and Seniors Act</strong></p> <p> This bill amends the Internal Revenue Code to roll back the increased threshold for determining the amount of the tax deduction for medical expenses. Currently, individual&nbsp;taxpayers under age 65&nbsp;may only deduct those medical expenses that exceed 10% of their adjusted gross income. This bill reduces that percentage to 7.5% for all taxpayers for tax years beginning after December 31, 2015. &nbsp;</p> <p>The threshold percentage remains at 10% for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax (AMT). </p>]]></summary-text>
