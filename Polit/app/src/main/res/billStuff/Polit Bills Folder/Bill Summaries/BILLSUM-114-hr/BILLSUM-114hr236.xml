(Currently, such activities are performed by the Department of the Treasury.) </p> <p>Requires DHS, if the CBP detains critical merchandise bearing a DHS-recorded registered trademark, to provide the trademark owner any information on such critical merchandise and its packaging and labels, including, without redaction, photographs or digital images, packaging, and labels.
