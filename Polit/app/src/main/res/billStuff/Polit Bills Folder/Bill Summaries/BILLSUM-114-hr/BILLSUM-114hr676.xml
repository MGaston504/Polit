<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Expanded &amp; Improved Medicare for All Act</b></p> <p>Establishes the Medicare for All Program to provide all individuals residing in the United States and U.S. territories with free health care that includes all medically necessary care, such as primary care and prevention, dietary and nutritional therapies, prescription drugs, emergency care, long-term care, mental health services, dental services, and vision care.</p> <p>Prohibits an institution from participating unless it is a public or nonprofit institution. Allows nonprofit health maintenance organizations (HMOs) that deliver care in their own facilities to participate. </p> <p>Allows patients to choose from participating physicians and institutions. </p> <p>Prohibits a private health insurer from selling health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this Act.
