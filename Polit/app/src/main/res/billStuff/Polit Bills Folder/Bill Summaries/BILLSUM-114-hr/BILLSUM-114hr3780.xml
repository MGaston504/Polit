<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Putting Patients and Providers Ahead of Compressed Regulatory Timelines Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to eliminate provider penalties for failure to comply with electronic health records (EHR) use requirements.</p> <p>Under current law, certain hospitals, Medicare Advantage organizations, and professionals participating in Medicare are subject to negative payment adjustments if they fail to comply with established requirements for EHR use. The bill eliminates these penalties and requires the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to reimburse&nbsp;such providers for payments that they would have received within a specified timeframe had such penalties not been applied.</p>]]></summary-text>
