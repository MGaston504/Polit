<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Coordinating Transportation Services for Transportation Disadvantaged Individuals Act of 2015</strong></p> <p>This bill establishes in the Department of Transportation (DOT) the New Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility to coordinate transportation services to transportation-disadvantaged individuals (those who require the use of public transportation but have difficulty accessing it due to disability, income level, age, or veteran status) in a manner that is cost effective and efficient and that minimizes the fragmentation and duplication of such services.</p> <p>The Council shall: </p> <ul> <li>develop a strategic plan that identifies federal agency roles and responsibilities and measurable outcomes in coordinating such services; </li> <li>develop a joint cost-sharing policy among federal agencies with representatives on the Council that provides clear guidance to state and local governments regarding cost allocation; </li> <li>maintain an inventory of all federal programs that provide such services; and </li> <li>partner with State Transport Coordinating Commissions (STCCs) and aid them in coordinating such services. </li></ul> <p>A state must establish an STCC to coordinate transportation for transportation-disadvantaged individuals. An STCC shall:</p> <ul> <li>compile information on transportation operations for and needs of such individuals; </li> <li>establish statewide objectives for coordinating transportation services for such individuals; </li> <li>develop written policies and procedures for the coordination of government funding for such individuals; </li> <li>identify and pursue the elimination of barriers to transportation services; </li> <li>establish an information clearinghouse; </li> <li>assist communities in developing transportation systems designed to serve such individuals; </li> <li>verify that purchasing procedures aid the coordination of such services; </li> <li>verify that purchasing agencies purchase all trips within transportation systems that serve such individuals, unless they use more cost-effective alternative providers; and </li> <li>develop a strategic plan that addresses the transportation problems and needs of such individuals over a five-year period. </li></ul> <p>DOT must withhold 1% of the amount required to be apportioned to a state under specified federal-aid highway programs on the first day of each fiscal year beginning with FY2017 if the state does not meet this bill's requirements. </p> <p>Each federal agency shall keep an accounting of expenditures directly related to services for transportation-disadvantaged individuals. No federal agency may make capital investments for the purpose of providing the services.</p> <p>The bill terminates the Interagency Transportation Coordinating Council on Access and Mobility.</p>]]></summary-text>
