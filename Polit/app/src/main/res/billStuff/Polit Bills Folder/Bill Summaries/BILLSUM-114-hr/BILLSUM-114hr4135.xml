<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Visa Waiver Program Firearms Clarification Act of 2015</b></p> <p>The bill amends the federal criminal code to modify the eligibility of certain foreign nationals to purchase and possess firearms in the United States.</p> <p>Current law prohibits firearm sale or transfer to or possession by a foreign national (i.e., alien) who is: (1) unlawfully present in the United States, or (2) lawfully present under a nonimmigrant visa (e.g., tourist visa). The prohibitions do not apply in certain circumstances.</p> <p>This bill expands the prohibition to bar firearm sale or transfer to or possession by a foreign national who was lawfully admitted to the United States without a visa under the Visa Waiver Program.</p> <p>The prohibitions do not apply to a foreign national lawfully admitted under the Visa Waiver Program if that foreign national is a government official or law enforcement officer, or possesses a hunting license. Additionally, such foreign national may apply for a Department of Justice waiver to allow firearm possession. </p>]]></summary-text>
