<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Educator Preparation Reform Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Higher Education Act of 1965 to add as purposes of teacher quality partnership grants: (1) recruiting profession ready individuals, including minorities and individuals from other occupations, as teachers, principals, and other educators; and (2) meeting the staffing needs of high-need local education agencies and high-need schools through close partnerships with educator preparation programs within institutions of higher education. </p> <p>An eligible partnership that receives a partnership grant shall use grant funds to carry out a program for the pre-baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate preparation of teachers, a teaching residency program (as in current law) or a principal residency program, or a combination of such programs. </p> <p>An eligible partnership carrying out a principal residency program must perform specified activities for high-need schools. </p> <p>The bill revises requirements for teacher residency programs and prescribes requirements for the establishment of principal residency programs. </p> <p>An eligible partnership that receives a partnership grant may carry out, instead of a leadership development program, effective educator development programs for other educators besides teachers and principals.</p> <p>The bill revises requirements for state reporting on the quality of teacher preparation. </p> <p>As a condition for receiving funds under this Act or under title II of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, a state must conduct an assessment to identify at-risk (as well as low-performing) teacher preparation programs.</p>]]></summary-text>
