<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>Medicaid Qualified Providers Clarification Act</strong></p> <p>This bill amends title XIX (Medicaid) of the Social Security Act to modify requirements regarding a state plan for medical assistance. Under current law, a state plan for medical assistance must provide that any individual eligible for medical assistance may obtain required services from any institution, agency, or person qualified to perform them. The bill specifies that a state may determine whether a provider is qualified to perform such services. To do so, a state may establish qualification criteria, which may include criteria designed to evaluate: (1) the provider's ability to perform the needed medical services in a professionally competent, safe, and legal manner; and (2) any other qualification deemed necessary by the state.</p>]]></summary-text>
