Each such report shall include, for each agency and for all agencies: </p> <ul> <li>the total amount of official time granted; </li> <li>the average amount of official time expended per bargaining unit employee;</li> <li> the specific types of activities or purposes for which official time was granted and its impact on agency operations; </li> <li>the number of employees tgranted official time and the number of such employees who were not engaged in any activities or purposes except those involving the use of official time; </li> <li>the total amount of compensation (including fringe benefits) afforded to employees in connection with activities or purposes for which they were granted official time; and </li> <li>a description of any room or space designated at the agency where official time activities will be conducted. </li> </ul> <p>TITLE VI--MIDNIGHT RULE RELIEF</p> <p>(Sec. 601) This title prohibits a federal agency (excluding the Federal Election Commission, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or the U.S. Postal Service) from proposing or adopting any midnight rule unless the OMB's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) finds that it will not result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs or prices; (3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, wages, investment, productivity, innovation, or the ability of U.S.-based enterprises to compete internationally; or (4) a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses. </p> <p>A &quot;midnight rule&quot; is an agency rule proposed or adopted during a moratorium period that begins on the day after the Tuesday next after the first Monday in November in every fourth year succeeding a presidential election and extends through January 20 of the following year in which a President is not serving a consecutive term. </p> <p>(Sec. 602) The OIRA must publish a list of midnight rules that are exempt from the prohibition because they are required by statute, regulation, or judicial order to be proposed or adopted by a deadline that was established before the moratorium and that occurs during the moratorium. </p> <p>(Sec. 603) Also exempt from the prohibition is any midnight rule that the President determines is necessary: (1) because of a state of emergency, (2) to enforce criminal laws, (3) to protect U.S. national security, or (4) to implement an international trade agreement. The moratorium does not apply to a midnight rule if the OIRA certifies that such rule is limited to repealing an existing rule. </p> <p>(Sec. 604) Judicial review is available to persons or entities subject to any midnight rule promulgated in violation of this title.</p> <p>TITLE VII--REQUIREMENT TO MAINTAIN RECORDS</p> <p>(Sec. 701) This title requires the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to maintain preserved records for at least three years after obtaining the record.
