<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Equal Employment for All Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Fair Credit Reporting Act governing the use of consumer reports for employment purposes to prohibit a consumer reporting agency from furnishing an employer with a consumer report containing information on the consumer's creditworthiness, credit standing, or credit capacity if the employer intends to use that information for any employment purposes, including denial of employment.</p> <p>The bill does permit an employer to use such a consumer credit report, however, in either an employment decision or before taking an adverse employment action if:</p> <ul> <li>the consumer both authorizes procurement of the report and also applies for, or currently holds, employment that requires eligibility for access to classified information; or</li> <li>such use is otherwise required by law.</li> </ul> <p>An employer who has sought such a report may neither deny employment to nor make any other employment decision about a consumer because the consumer has not authorized the employer's procurement of the report.</p>]]></summary-text>
