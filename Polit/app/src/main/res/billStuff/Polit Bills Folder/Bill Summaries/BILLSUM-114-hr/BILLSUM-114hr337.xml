<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Maritime Lien Reform Act</b></p> <p>This bill revises federal shipping laws governing maritime liability to prohibit: (1) maritime liens (liens on vessels) from being imposed on state or federal fishing permits, or (2) civil actions to enforce maritime liens on the permits. A fishing permit is not considered to be part of a vessel, so it does not pass with a vessel upon the vessel's sale or transfer.</p>]]></summary-text>
