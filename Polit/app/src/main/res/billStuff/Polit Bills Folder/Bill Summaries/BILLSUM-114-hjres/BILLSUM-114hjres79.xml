<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Constitutional Amendment </b></p> <p>This joint resolution proposes a constitutional amendment prohibiting total outlays from exceeding total receipts for a fiscal year unless Congress authorizes the excess by a three-fifths roll call vote of each chamber. The prohibition excludes outlays for repayment of debt principal and receipts derived from borrowing. </p> <p>The President must submit a balanced budget to Congress annually. If the President does not submit a balanced budget for a fiscal year, no executive orders may be issued until the earlier of the submission of a balanced budget or the first day of the fiscal year. </p> <p>A three-fifths roll call vote of each chamber of Congress is required to increase the public debt limit. </p> <p>Congress may waive the requirements for any period during which the United States is engaged in military conflict that causes an imminent and serious military threat to national security. </p>]]></summary-text>
