<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><strong>CEO-Employee Paycheck Fairness Act of 2015 </strong></p> <p>Amends the Internal Revenue Code to deny a publicly held corporation a tax deduction for the payment of performance-based remuneration in excess of $1 million to any of its current or former&nbsp;officers or directors if such corporation does not meet the pay fairness requirement established by this Act.
