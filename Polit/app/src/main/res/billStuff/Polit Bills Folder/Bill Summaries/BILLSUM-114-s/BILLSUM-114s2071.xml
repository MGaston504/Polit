<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality and Access Act of 2015</b></p> <p>This bill amends title XVIII (Medicare) of the Social Security Act to: (1) require the payment system for ambulatory surgical center (ASC) services to feature certain positive annual adjustments equivalent to those made with respect to hospital outpatient department (OPD) services; (2) revise quality reporting requirements to&nbsp;permit publicly available, side-by-side comparisons of quality measures for ASCs and OPDs in the same geographic area; and (3) require the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), when excluding&nbsp;requested procedures from the list of those approved to be performed in ASCs, to cite specified reasons for doing so.</p> <p>With respect to excluding procedures from the approved list for ASCs, HHS may not cite as a basis for exclusion that a procedure can only be reported using an unlisted surgical procedure code.&nbsp;(Physicians sometimes use unlisted codes when performing new procedures or services if no existing code is adequately descriptive.)</p>]]></summary-text>
