<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety Act of 2015 </b></p> <p>This bill authorizes appropriations for FY2016-FY2019 for the highway safety improvement program, with $50 million set aside for each fiscal year for the Railway-Highway Crossings Program.</p> <p>The limitation to three states per year is eliminated, so all states now become eligible for the award of Highway-Rail Grade Crossing Safety improvement grants to develop or continue enhanced public education and awareness activities, in combination with targeted law enforcement, to reduce traffic law violations at highway-rail grade crossings, as well as to prevent and reduce injuries and fatalities along railroad rights-of-way. The limitation on grant amounts awarded to a state is increased from $250,000 to $2.5 million.</p> <p>Eligibility requirements are revised for the award of capital grants to states under the rail line relocation and improvement program.</p> <p>Increased appropriations under the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 are authorized for FY2016-FY2019 for the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) to make grants to the Operation Lifesaver program. </p> <p>The FRA shall hire:</p> <ul> <li> 16 full-time grade crossing safety managers to work with state and local officials to identify safety improvements to highway-rail grade crossings; and </li> <li>8 trespass prevention managers to work with local governments, schools, businesses, and railroads to develop site-specific mitigation plans.</li> </ul> <p>The Secretary of Transportation shall study the feasibility of requiring railroads to provide additional means for the public to report problems at highway-rail grade crossings, including via a website and text messaging.</p>]]></summary-text>
