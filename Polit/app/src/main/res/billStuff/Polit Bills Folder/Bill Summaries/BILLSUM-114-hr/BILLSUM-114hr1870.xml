<summary-text><![CDATA[<p>This bill requires the Department of Energy (DOE) to carry out a grant program to enhance the nation's economic, environmental, and energy security by making awards to consortia for establishing and operating Energy Innovation Hubs to conduct and support multidisciplinary, collaborative research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of advanced energy technologies. Advanced energy technologies are innovative technologies or research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities necessary to ensure the long-term, secure, and sustainable supply of energy critical elements. These elements have a high risk of a supply disruption and are critical to new, energy-related technologies in that a shortage of the element would significantly inhibit large-scale deployment of technologies that produce, transmit, store, or conserve energy. </p> <p>Examples of advanced energy technology include an innovative technology that:</p> <ul> <li>produces energy from renewable energy resources; </li> <li> produces nuclear energy; </li> <li>includes carbon capture and sequestration; </li> <li>enables advanced vehicles, vehicle components, and related technologies that result in significant energy savings; </li> <li> generates, transmits, distributes, utilizes, or stores energy more efficiently than conventional technologies; and </li> <li> enhances the energy independence and security of the United States by enabling improved or expanded supply and production of domestic energy resources.</li> </ul> <p>DOE must designate a unique advanced energy technology focus for each hub. </p> <p>Grants may not be used for constructing new buildings or facilities for hubs. Further, construction of new buildings or facilities may not be considered as part of the non-federal share of a hub cost-sharing agreement. Grants and non-federal cost share funds may be used for research or for the construction of a test bed or renovations to existing buildings or facilities for the purposes of research.</p>]]></summary-text>
