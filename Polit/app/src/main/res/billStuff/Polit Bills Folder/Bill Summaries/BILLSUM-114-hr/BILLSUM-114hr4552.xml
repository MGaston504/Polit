<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Gas Pump Access Act of 2016</b></p> <p>This bill declares that it shall be a prohibited form of discrimination against individuals with disabilities in a place of public accommodation under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 for a gas station or convenience store to fail to clearly display at each self-service gas pump a decal that includes its telephone number and the words &quot;Call for Assistance.&quot;</p> <p>A gas station or convenience store that is open for business to the public with at least two attendants on duty must provide gas pumping assistance to a qualified individual with a disability who makes a request for such assistance. But it shall not be considered discrimination for a gas station or convenience store with one attendant on duty to fail to provide such requested gas pumping assistance if such attendant notifies the individual that assistance cannot be provided because there is only one attendant on duty.</p> <p>The Department of Transportation and the Department of Justice must: (1) promulgate regulations necessary to ensure compliance with this Act, and (2) make graphics for the decals publicly available on their websites.</p>]]></summary-text>
