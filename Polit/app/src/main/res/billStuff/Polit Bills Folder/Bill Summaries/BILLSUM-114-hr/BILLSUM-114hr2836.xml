<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>Fair Access for Moms Act</b></p> <p>This bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to revise maximum hours requirements to subject employers with less than 15 employees (currently, less than 50) to the requirement that they provide a reasonable break time and place for their employees to express breast milk for a nursing child at the work place.
