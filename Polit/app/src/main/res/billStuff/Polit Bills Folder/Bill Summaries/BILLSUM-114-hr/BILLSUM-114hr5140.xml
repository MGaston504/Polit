<summary-text><![CDATA[<p><b>VFD Repeal Act of 2016</b></p> This bill repeals the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA's) final rule regarding the Veterinary Feed Directive published on June 3, 2015, and prohibits the FDA from issuing any similar rule. (Veterinary Feed Directive regulations prohibit the use of medically important antibiotics for animal production purposes. Under these regulations, an animal producer may only use such antibiotics with the authorization of a veterinarian for the prevention, control, or treatment of a specifically identified disease. The rule repealed by this bill revised those regulations, including to require a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship for a veterinarian to authorize the use of antibiotics.)]]></summary-text>
