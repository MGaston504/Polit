	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas Food Protein-Induced Enterocolitis Syndrome (FPIES) is a form of food allergy that primarily affects the gastrointestinal system and adversely impacts the lives of young children throughout the nation;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas children with FPIES may experience acute and severe allergic reactions for which they may require emergency room treatment;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas FPIES patients may suffer chronically from the disorder and develop health issues, such as failure to thrive, long-term feeding problems, and food aversions, for which there is no treatment;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a diagnosis of FPIES leads to significant dietary restrictions and imposes a substantial reduction in quality of life on children with FPIES and their families;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas families with children who suffer from FPIES are often unaware that the condition exists, and health care providers often misdiagnose the condition or are unaware of available treatment options;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there is a tremendous need to generate awareness of FPIES to ensure that health care providers are able to quickly and effectively diagnose FPIES and schools and childcare providers are able to effectively care for those who struggle with this condition;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas it is essential that necessary treatment and dietary options be accessible and available to families with children suffering from FPIES; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas increasing FPIES awareness will encourage all people of the United States to provide comfort to families with children suffering from this condition and collectively work towards finding better treatments: Now, therefore, be it</text>
