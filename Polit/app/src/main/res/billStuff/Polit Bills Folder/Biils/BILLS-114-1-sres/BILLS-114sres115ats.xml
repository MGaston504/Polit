	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas congenital diaphragmatic hernia (referred to in this preamble as <quote>CDH</quote>) occurs when the diaphragm fails to fully form, allowing abdominal organs to migrate into the chest cavity and preventing lung growth;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes CDH as a birth defect;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the majority of CDH patients suffer from underdeveloped lungs or poor pulmonary function;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas babies born with CDH endure extended hospital stays in intensive care with multiple surgeries;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH patients often endure long-term complications, such as pulmonary hypertension, pulmonary hypoplasia, asthma, gastrointestinal reflex, feeding disorders, and developmental delays;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH survivors sometimes endure long-term mechanical ventilation dependency, skeletal malformations, supplemental oxygen dependency, enteral and parenteral nutrition, and hypoxic brain injury;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH is treated through mechanical ventilation, a heart and lung bypass (commonly known as <quote>extracorporeal membrane oxygenation</quote>), machines, and surgical repair;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas surgical repair is often not a permanent solution for CDH and can lead to reherniation and require additional surgery;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH is diagnosed in utero in less than 50 percent of cases;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas infants born with CDH have a high mortality rate, ranging from 20 to 60 percent, depending on the severity of the defect and interventions available at delivery;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH has a rate of occurrence of 1 in every 3,800 live births worldwide;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH affects approximately 1,088 babies each year in the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH has affected more than 700,000 babies worldwide since 2000;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas CDH does not discriminate based on race, gender, or socioeconomic status;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the cause of CDH is unknown;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the average CDH survivor will face postnatal care of at least $100,000; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Federal support for CDH research at the National Institutes of Health for 2014 is estimated to be not more than $2,500,000: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
