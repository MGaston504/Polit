 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0F8DCE6BA6884A9CAEF3FA2FDD73234E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>A combination of sustained drought, foreign competition, changing domestic markets, industry restructuring, and individual ranch finances has resulted in Federal grazing permits and leases becoming stranded investments for many permittees and lessees.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5CADBF05A13A401F8FF205FE16A69DE6"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Attempts to resolve grazing conflicts with other multiple uses often require extensive range developments, intensive herd management, and continuous monitoring that greatly increases costs to both permittees and lessees and taxpayers, far out of proportion to the benefit received.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0049419C7D674D50816AB767EC051731"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Certain grazing allotments on Federal lands have, or are likely to become, unsuitable for commercial livestock production as a result of the combined effect of the factors referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) and other factors.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8B1CB019D43C43BF9E4BCF3614279FCE"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Compensating permittees and lessees who relinquish their grazing permit or lease would help recapitalize an ailing sector of rural America by providing economic options to permittees and lessees that do not presently exist by allowing them to restructure their ranch operations, start new businesses, or retire with security.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA2B35967532F40B68C11C2DF99794AD9"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Paying reasonable compensation for the relinquishment of a grazing permit or lease will help alleviate the need for permittees and lessees to sell or subdivide their private lands.</text>
