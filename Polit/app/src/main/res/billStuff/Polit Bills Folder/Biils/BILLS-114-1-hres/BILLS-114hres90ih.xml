 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas stormwater flows continue to bring substantial amounts of sediment, trash, and other contaminants into the Tijuana Valley from sources in both the United States and Mexico causing water quality impairments, threatening life and property from flooding, degrading valuable riparian and estuarine habitats, and negatively impacting people on both sides of the international boundary;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the San Diego field office of the USIBWC has been an active participant of the Tijuana River Valley Recovery Team which was formed in an effort to develop local solutions to sediment and trash depositions issues for the Tijuana River;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sediment, trash, and other pollutants carried in stormwater runoff currently threaten the valley’s valuable ecological, recreational, and economic resources;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on June 19, 2012, the USIBWC convened a binational meeting among stakeholders to hear presentations regarding trash, sediment, and water quality issues;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the USIBWC has jurisdiction over key watersheds along the border in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the USIBWC works directly with local communities to conserve transboundary rivers in San Diego, California, Calexico, California, Nogales, Arizona, Douglas, Arizona, El Paso, Texas, and Laredo, Texas;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the USIBWC is a key component of the United States strategy to partner with Mexico to provide a binational forum to administer the water-rights between the two nations;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States and Mexico have the common goal of reducing pollutants at the source on both sides of the border; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States will continue to utilize existing mechanisms, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency Border 2020 program, the Border Environmental Cooperation Commission and local public and private entities to address environmental concerns on the border: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
