 <paragraph id="H2DC96156131E406FB7A6101FC82F5215"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The phrase <term>no taxation without representation</term> was a rallying cry of many American colonists during the period of British rule in the 1760s and early 1770s. The slogan gained widespread notoriety after the passage of the Sugar Act on April 5, 1764.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H37CE9D3A7078408BBD78F085FB0B75BC"><enum>(2)</enum><text>American colonists increasingly resented being levied taxes without having actual legislators seated and voting in Parliament in London. The idea that there should be no taxation without representation dated back even further. Benjamin Franklin stated, <quote>it is suppos’d an undoubted Right of Englishmen not to be taxed but by their own Consent given thro’ their Representatives.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4ED527F346934325A1DB64E1BE6B73FA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>This issue became even more defined in 1765 with the passage of the Stamp Act which was the first true attempt to levy a direct tax on the American colonies. Ultimately the tax was repealed, but the idea of no taxation without representation persisted.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9DC9117F84BB431EA6EDB376689577A1"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Article I, section 2, clause 1 of the United States Constitution, states, <quote>The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC61D4AD66BC044A79AE613B78449D46C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Organic Act of 1801 placed Washington, DC, under the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States Congress and people in the District were no longer considered residents of Virginia or Maryland.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB9B4AD93B3CB4095AA07CF6F8BB1652F"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Many in Washington, DC, were immediately opposed to the idea of being taxed without congressional representation and over the years several congressional leaders introduced constitutional amendments to give the District of Columbia voting representation, though none were successful.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97D5CB5C06844333A301DC9D071CF8D2"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 1898, Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States and currently has a Resident Commissioner with limited voting rights. <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/933">Section 933</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 exempts bona fide citizens who are residents of Puerto Rico for the entire taxable year from Federal taxes on income earned in Puerto Rico.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEA05985B5CD847F2B9AB180FD54B8773"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">On March 31, 1917, the United States took possession of the Virgin Islands and in 1927, the territory’s residents were granted citizenship. Under <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/932">section 932</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, individuals who are bona fide residents of the United States Virgin Islands during the entire taxable year, and who fully pay all income tax liabilities to the United States Virgin Islands, are not subject to Federal income taxes on their income.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1781BDCB611E4B3391604A2150AB97F0"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Guam was established as a territory of the United States after the passage of the Guam Organic Act of 1950. Under the provisions of <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/935">section 935</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, residents of Guam are required to file tax returns with Guam, but not with the United States Federal Government and therefore the residents do not have to pay United States Federal income taxes.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H381FD602BAD348A1851712AB707D29DF"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands was established in 1975 after residents decided not to pursue independence, but instead they opted to enter into territory negotiations. The tax treatment of the Northern Mariana Islands is similar to the structure of Guam in that bona fide residents are not required to pay Federal income taxes.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7F37E1292A3F4BBA9B455472252E0412"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">American Samoa, which is technically considered <term>unorganized</term> because no Organic Acts have been passed by Congress, is governed by <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/26/931">section 931</external-xref> of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Under this section, bona fide year-round residents are exempt from Federal taxes on income they earn in Samoa, Guam, and Northern Mariana Islands, but are subject to Federal taxes on income earned elsewhere.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HAB98D35C251B4CA5A710F43FFE524A20"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In keeping with the early history and democratic traditions of the United States, the principles established in the Constitution, and in conformance with the other territories of the United States which have delegates but no Representative, the residents of the District of Columbia should be exempt from paying United States Federal income taxes.</text>
