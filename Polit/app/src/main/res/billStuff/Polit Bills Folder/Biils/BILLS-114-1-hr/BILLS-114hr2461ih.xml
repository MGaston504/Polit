The estimated total cost of these fractures in 2005 was $17 billion and expected to rise to over $25 billion by 2025.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H189405FE36EB4643ADD8A7391FD87D64"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Osteoporosis is a silent disease that often is not discovered until a fracture occurs. One out of two women and up to one of four men will suffer an osteoporotic fracture in their lifetimes.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H097DD0C64C1D426EACD5569EB589A2D8"><enum>(3)</enum><text>While both men and women may develop osteoporosis, 80 percent are women.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H314B82748CD44D0DAE51729EAB137730"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Most women are not aware of their personal risk factors for osteoporosis, the prevalence of, or the morbidity and mortality associated with the disease, despite the fact that broken bones due to osteoporosis lead to more hospitalizations and greater health care costs than heart attack, stroke, or breast cancer in women age 55 and above.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H26C27AFDD00144C7A116BA73FD038C87"><enum>(5)</enum><text>A woman’s risk of hip fracture is equal to her combined risk of breast, uterine, and ovarian cancer. More women die in the United States in the year following a hip fracture than from breast cancer.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAC8F4D691C04418681A7AA6CE8AF870D"><enum>(6)</enum><text>One out of four people who have an osteoporotic hip fracture will need long-term nursing home care. Half of those who experience osteoporotic hip fractures are unable to walk without assistance.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H00FA7B29C3FC4704BEA60DD2C1C69FA1"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Elderly women are so afraid of losing their independence that 8 in 10 would rather die than break their hip and be admitted to a nursing home.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB2FB5CA97E0642E1AF6162A8EE1C18D3"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Bone density testing is more powerful in predicting fractures than cholesterol is in predicting myocardial infarction or blood pressure in predicting stroke.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1F620ED63F8D4C819B1C18A11A4145E3"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Osteoporosis remains both under-recognized and under-treated. Over a 7-year period (2002–2008), 41 percent of older female Medicare beneficiaries had no DXA bone density test, and 25 percent had only 1 test.</text></paragraph>
