<paragraph id="H9115D121112E46878E1348022CC1DBDD"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In the 1979–1980 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant paid for 77 percent of the average cost of attendance at an in-State, 4-year institution of higher education. However, in the 2014–2015 academic year, the maximum Federal Pell Grant covered less than one-third of that average cost of attendance.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3CC438E2A41C4F01B940173484458EAF"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The program providing Federal Pell Grants already acts as a quasi-entitlement, in which both mandatory funding and discretionary funding combine to maintain a maximum Federal Pell Grant amount.</text></paragraph>
<paragraph id="H1E29AB1B38604996995335077211C3A5"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Congressional Budget Office reports on any overall financial surplus or shortfall in the funding provided for the Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent years, in order to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the provided level of funding, Congress has made cuts to the program through imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell Grants and limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell Grants, causing significant uncertainty and reducing access to higher education for millions of hardworking college students.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H3CF1E46A0D6248ADB58074FE346E7FD7"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Removing the Federal Pell Grant program from the uncertainty of the congressional discretionary appropriations process will improve student access to, and the affordability of, higher education.</text></paragraph></section>
