 <paragraph id="H58C646B01BEF49E898841D4578EA2ED5"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Approximately 28,000,000 Americans are afflicted with some hearing loss and it has been estimated that 10,000,000 of these impairments are at least partially attributable to damage from exposure to noise.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8F72B3C300174BE0A6CA650A643BB823"><enum>(2)</enum><text>For millions of Americans, noise from aircraft, vehicular traffic, and a variety of other sources is a constant source of torment. Millions of Americans are exposed to noise levels that can lead to sleep loss, psychological and physiological damage, and work disruption.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC4C5150756F747ED96DD941F001AFEDA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Chronic exposure to noise has been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disorders, learning deficits in children, stress, and diminished quality of life.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4D11739E1716491DBC13D64EBA073A87"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Excessive noise leading to sleep deprivation and task interruptions can result in untold costs on society in diminished worker productivity.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1B29D9C713724C94A8835F11155509D3"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Pursuant to authorities granted under the Clean Air Act of 1970, the Noise Control Act of 1972, and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978, the Environmental Protection Agency established an Office of Noise Abatement and Control. Its responsibilities included promulgating noise emission standards, requiring product labeling, facilitating the development of low emission products, coordinating Federal noise reduction programs, assisting State and local abatement efforts, and promoting noise education and research. However, funding for the Office of Noise Abatement and Control was terminated in 1982 and no funds have been provided since.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8F6DDC39746F425A9B386A6AC1FB739E"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Because the Environmental Protection Agency remains legally responsible for enforcing regulations issued under the Noise Control Act of 1972 even though funding for these activities were terminated, and because the Noise Control Act of 1972 prohibits State and local governments from regulating noise sources in many situations, noise abatement programs across the country lie dormant.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H45F0677658324B569999EB8A21000148"><enum>(7)</enum><text>As population growth and air and vehicular traffic continue to increase, noise pollution is likely to become an even greater problem in the future. The health and welfare of our citizens demands that the Environmental Protection Agency, the lead Federal agency for the protection of public health and welfare, once again assume a role in combating noise pollution.</text>
