 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including—</text>

 </paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-Semitic violence;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on December 6, 2013, the Ministerial Council of the OSCE, which is composed of the Foreign Ministers of participating States, adopted Decision number 3/13 entitled <quote>Freedom of Thought, Conscience, Religion, or Belief</quote>, emphasizing <quote>the link between security and full respect for the freedom of thought</quote>, and committing member governments to adopt <quote>policies to promote respect and protection for places of worship and religious sites, religious monuments, cemeteries and shrines against vandalism and destruction</quote>, among other specific actions;</text>
