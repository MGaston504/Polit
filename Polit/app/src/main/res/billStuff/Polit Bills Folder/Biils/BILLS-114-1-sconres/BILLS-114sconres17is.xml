 <whereas><text>Whereas there are more than 3,500 rules issued every year by more than 50 Federal agencies;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a rule is defined in section 551 of title 5, United States Code, as <quote>the whole or part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the <quote>Administrative Procedure Act</quote>) established standards for the issuance of rules using formal rulemaking and informal rulemaking procedures;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas informal rulemaking, also known as <quote>notice and comment</quote> rulemaking or <quote>section 553</quote> rulemaking, is the most common type of rulemaking;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas in rulemaking proceedings, formal hearings must be held and interested parties must be given the chance to comment on the proposed rule or regulation, and once adopted, the rule or regulation is required to be published in the Federal Register;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to a 2005 study commissioned by the Small Business Administration, the cost of all rules in effect was approximately $1,100,000,000,000 per year, more than the people of the United States paid in Federal income taxes in 2009;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, the top 6 Federal rulemaking agencies (which, in 2013, were the Departments of the Treasury, Commerce, Interior, Health and Human Services, and Transportation and the Environmental Protection Agency) account for 49.3 percent of all Federal rules;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, small businesses pay more in per-employee regulatory costs, and firms with fewer than 20 employees pay an average of $10,585 per employee, compared to $7,755 for those with 500 or more employees;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the 2014 Ten Thousand Commandments report by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, regulatory costs amount to an average of $14,974 per household, which is 23 percent of the average household income of $65,596 and 29 percent of the expenditure budget of $51,442;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to a 2011 study by the Weidenbaum Center at Washington University, it is estimated that the budgetary cost of administering and enforcing Federal regulations by Federal agencies for fiscal year 2012 amounted to more than $57 billion (in 2005 dollars), which represents a 10.5-percent increase in 2 years;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas <external-xref legal-doc="usc-chapter" parsable-cite="usc-chapter/5/8">chapter 8</external-xref> of title 5, United States Code (commonly known as the <quote>Congressional Review Act</quote>) established a mechanism through which Congress could overturn Federal regulations by enacting a joint resolution of disapproval;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Congressional Review Act requires that rules that have a $100,000,000 effect or more on the economy are submitted by agencies to both Houses of Congress and the Government Accountability Office and have a delayed effective date of not less than 60 days to pass a resolution of disapproval rejecting the rule, which must be approved by the President; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, since the enactment of the Congressional Review Act in 1996, the procedures under the Act have been used 1 time to overturn a rule: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
