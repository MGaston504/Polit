	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas, on October 1, 1965, 6 Indonesian Army generals were killed by military personnel, including members of Indonesia’s Presidential Guard, and these killings were blamed on the Indonesian Communist Party and labeled an <quote>attempted Communist coup d’état</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas this alleged coup was used to justify the mass killing of alleged supporters of the Indonesian Communist Party, with estimates of the number of dead ranging from 500,000 to 1,000,000 killed;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the targeted individuals were predominantly unarmed civilians, and often included members of trade unions, intellectuals, teachers, ethnic Chinese, and those involved in the women’s movement;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these killings and the imprisonment of up to 1,000,000 targeted individuals were done without due process of law;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the targeted individuals were subject to extrajudicial execution, torture, rape, forced disappearance, forced labor, and forced eviction;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Central Intelligence Agency, in a 1968 research study, described the period as one of the worst mass murders of the twentieth century;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government provided the Indonesian Army with financial, military, and intelligence support during the period of the mass killings, and did so aware that such killings were taking place as recorded in partially declassified documents in the Department of State history, <quote>Foreign Relations of the United States</quote>, pertaining to this period;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, within months of military leader Suharto’s assumption of the Presidency following the mass killing, the United States Government began sending economic and military support to Suharto’s military regime, and played an indispensable role in its consolidation of power;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas aid to the Suharto government continued for more than 3 decades, despite on-going crimes against humanity committed by the Suharto government, including mass killing and other gross violations of human rights during the invasion and subsequent 24-year occupation of East Timor;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas perpetrators of the 1965 and 1966 mass killings have largely lived with impunity, and the survivors and descendants of the victims suffer continuing economic discrimination and had limited civil and political rights for decades, as noted in the 2012 report by the Indonesian National Commission on Human Rights;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has not yet fully declassified all relevant documents concerning this time period, and full disclosure could help bring historical clarity to atrocities committed in Indonesia during 1965 and 1966;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has recently supported the declassification and release of documents in support of truth and reconciliation efforts following periods of violence in countries such as Chile and Brazil;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas open dialogue about alleged past crimes against humanity and past human rights violations is important for continued efforts to reconcile populations of Indonesia and to ensure a stable, sustainable peace that will benefit the region and beyond;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, Indonesia has undergone a remarkable democratic transition over the last 2 decades, and is the world’s third largest democracy with the largest Muslim population in the world;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas through free and fair elections, the people of Indonesia have elected new leaders who now have the opportunity to establish a culture of accountability in partnership with the country’s vibrant civil society, press, academia, and human rights activists;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the relationship between the United States and Indonesia is strong and involves many shared interests, as reflected in the 2010 United States-Indonesia Comprehensive Partnership, including democracy and civil society, education, security, climate and environment, energy, and trade and investment;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the economic relationship between the United States and Indonesia is strong, with bilateral goods trade exceeding $27,000,000,000 and with major United States companies making significant long-term investments in Indonesia; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas strong relations between the United States and Indonesia are mutually beneficial to both countries: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
