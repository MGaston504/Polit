 </paragraph><paragraph id="id87584225acc444d1b068b1f3960e3df9"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Census Bureau’s data also illustrates that young people are the fastest growing segment of the population in developing countries.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ida732085c950548179697510b301e6bbd"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Even though most countries do have birth registration laws, four out of ten babies born in 2012 were not registered worldwide. Moreover, an estimated 36 percent of children under the age of five worldwide (about 230,000,000 children) do not possess a birth certificate.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3c92d6f99f584a91a518b8fa801734fc"><enum>(4)</enum><text>A nationally recognized proof of birth system is important to determining a child’s citizenship, nationality, place of birth, parentage, and age. Without such a system, a passport, driver’s license, or other identification card is difficult to obtain. The lack of such documentation can prevent girls and women from officially participating in and benefitting from the formal economic, legal, and political sectors in their countries.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idc932e7ee5b864670a7f99a45fe09a51f"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The lack of birth registration among girls worldwide is particularly concerning as it can exacerbate the disproportionate vulnerability of women to trafficking, child marriage, and lack of access to health and education services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id54b222af26e74da58989c45597d644d1"><enum>(6)</enum><text>A lack of birth registration among women and girls can also aggravate what, in many places, amounts to an already reduced ability to seek employment, participate in civil society, or purchase or inherit land and other assets.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ide85dbfe93bc44976b4bb447cd3900ccf"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Girls undertake much of the domestic labor needed for poor families to survive: carrying water, harvesting crops, tending livestock, caring for younger children, and doing chores.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3fedcf2ccda34d219763688288d4b531"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Accurate assessments of access to education, poverty levels, and overall census activities are hampered by the lack of official information on women and girls. Without this rudimentary information, assessments of foreign assistance and domestic social welfare programs are difficult to gauge.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id61492e52a0a84cecb1e611f54b34b920"><enum>(9)</enum><text>To help ensure that women and girls are considered in United States foreign assistance policies and programs, that their needs are addressed in the design, implementation, and evaluation of foreign assistance programs, and that women and girls have the opportunity to succeed, it is important that girls be counted and have access to birth certificates and other official documentation.</text>
