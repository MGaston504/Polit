 <paragraph id="H6558AD5471FA4C5984E809A32E75D3FC"><enum>(1)</enum><text>in response to a financial crisis and the ensuing Great Depression, Congress enacted the Banking Act of 1933, known as the <quote>Glass-Steagall Act</quote>, to prohibit commercial banks from offering investment banking and insurance services;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB99D4900B3824566BDB96EEE111570EE"><enum>(2)</enum><text>a series of deregulatory decisions by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, in addition to decisions by Federal courts, permitted commercial banks to engage in an increasing number of risky financial activities that had previously been restricted under the Glass-Steagall Act, and also vastly expanded the meaning of the <quote>business of banking</quote> and <quote>closely related activities</quote> in banking law;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97DEF570FD034B80A047E903591D4221"><enum>(3)</enum><text>in 1999, Congress enacted the <quote>Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act</quote>, which repealed the Glass-Steagall Act separation between commercial and investment banking and allowed for complex cross-subsidies and interconnections between commercial and investment banks;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9C8D24BBBBF44AC6A038ECBF1AE1EDD0"><enum>(4)</enum><text>former Kansas City Federal Reserve President Thomas Hoenig observed that <quote>with the elimination of Glass-Steagall, the largest institutions with the greatest ability to leverage their balance sheets increased their risk profile by getting into trading, market making, and hedge fund activities, adding ever greater complexity to their balance sheets.</quote>;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB629209D04F44D7DAC449DB15468483E"><enum>(5)</enum><text>the Financial Crisis Inquiry Report issued by the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission concluded that, in the years between the passage of Gramm-Leach Bliley and the global financial crisis, <quote>regulation and supervision of traditional banking had been weakened significantly, allowing commercial banks and thrifts to operate with fewer constraints and to engage in a wider range of financial activities, including activities in the shadow banking system.</quote> The Commission also concluded that <quote>[t]his deregulation made the financial system especially vulnerable to the financial crisis and exacerbated its effects.</quote>;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE2F7034AD239442682B74765BCD1C44B"><enum>(6)</enum><text>a report by the Financial Stability Oversight Council pursuant to section 123 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act states that increased complexity and diversity of financial activities at financial institutions may <quote>shift institutions towards more risk-taking, increase the level of interconnectedness among financial firms, and therefore may increase systemic default risk. These potential costs may be exacerbated in cases where the market perceives diverse and complex financial institutions as ‘too big to fail,’ which may lead to excessive risk taking and concerns about moral hazard.</quote>;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H91916F9A40534CD5B1DDA0B23929A471"><enum>(7)</enum><text>the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations report, <quote>Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: Anatomy of a Financial Collapse</quote>, states that repeal of Glass-Steagall <quote>made it more difficult for regulators to distinguish between activities intended to benefit customers versus the financial institution itself. The expanded set of financial services investment banks were allowed to offer also contributed to the multiple and significant conflicts of interest that arose between some investment banks and their clients during the financial crisis.</quote>;</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" id="H1AE4C1524A164DB8B2DAF8D35E2DB315"><enum>(10)</enum><text>private sector actors prefer having access to underpriced public sector insurance, whether explicit (for insured deposits) or implicit (for <quote>too big to fail</quote> financial institutions), to subsidize dangerous levels of risk-taking, which, from a broader social perspective, is not an advantageous arrangement; and</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H04715C3CD1F54FD0AEFF553904DB0917"><enum>(11)</enum><text>the financial crisis, and the regulatory response to the crisis, has led to more mergers between financial institutions, creating greater financial sector consolidation and increasing the dominance of a few large, complex financial institutions that are generally considered to be <quote>too big to fail</quote>, and therefore are perceived by the markets as having an implicit guarantee from the Federal Government to bail them out in the event of their failure.</text>
