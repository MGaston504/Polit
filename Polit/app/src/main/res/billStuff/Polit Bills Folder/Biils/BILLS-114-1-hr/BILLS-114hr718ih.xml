 <paragraph id="H86542BBC3E4D4DEE96712C459721EEFD"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The community school model effectively leverages multiple education funding streams, which results in greater resources for a school. Community schools increase and sustain capacity through diversified financial support and leverage, on average, 3 dollars from private and other sources for every 1 dollar of State funding provided to the schools. According to Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, for every dollar spent on community schools, the United States is getting back 5, 6, or 7 dollars from the business community, nonprofit organizations, social service agencies, and State and Federal governments.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5AF4A0CE32324CD7ACA949C8A4109A40"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to Linda Darling-Hammond, the Charles DuCommon Professor of Education at Stanford University, community schools, which make local schools the hub of education and health services for children and families, have proven to be highly successful and are cost effective and replicable. Community schools are a force for development and stability that strengthens families and communities, and such schools offer childcare and early learning, family literacy and job-training, tutoring and enrichment before and after school, and on-site health clinics.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8E53AE212F0D4858A19BC6EDA45BE347"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The bulk of community school resources go directly to assist schools in meeting the schools' core instructional missions, while also strengthening the health and well-being of students, families, and neighborhoods. Community schools dedicate approximately 57 percent of expenditures to support learning through academic enrichment and after school activities, summer learning programs, early childhood education, service learning and civic engagement, life skills, sports, and recreation. The second largest expenditure, 19 percent, is directed towards health and mental health services, which ensure that children are physically able to learn and that health-related barriers are identified and addressed. On average, 12 percent of the resources are spent on supporting families, adult education, and immigrant services. Twelve percent is spent on staff sites, including the costs of a coordinator, tutors, interns, mentors, and volunteers, working on the alignment of activities for the community school.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H83361304934440B4A53575499F722242"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Tulsa Area Community Schools Initiative (TACSI) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, operates 18 community schools that serve as centers of community life, offering comprehensive programs, services, and opportunities to students, families, and the neighboring community. Researchers compared 18 TACSI schools to 18 non-TACSI schools and found that students in TACSI schools that had deeply embedded the community school model scored significantly higher than comparable students in non-TACSI schools on mathematics achievement tests. Further, the 18 TACSI schools had higher ratings of instructional leadership and effective supervisory practices, a stronger culture of faculty trust, and higher levels of student trust of teachers, school identification among students, parent trust in school, and school outreach, than the comparison schools.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCFD2B081903F4FA494D05BBDFBEFDFB1"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In Multnomah County, Oregon, Schools Uniting Neighborhoods (SUN) transforms schools into community schools. SUN is a partnership of Multnomah County, the City of Portland, including Children’s Investment Fund, local school districts, the Oregon Department of Human Services, a Business Leader’s Roundtable, and nonprofit organizations. Data shows that students who regularly participated in SUN activities showed strong gains in academics, attendance, and behavioral areas. There was a 76 percent increase in State benchmark scores in reading and mathematics for such students, the average daily school attendance at such schools was 95 percent, and 74 percent of the students had a more positive attitude toward schools.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC9EA1193E735489A8804BE681A35E9A7"><enum>(6)</enum><text>All Cincinnati, Ohio, public schools are using some level of the community school strategy. Cincinnati Public Schools have been the most improved urban district in Ohio. Cincinnati, Ohio, is the first urban district in the State to receive an <term>effective</term> rating. The district had a rating of <term>academic emergency</term> when the districtwide community learning center program first began. Oyler Elementary School, where 92 percent of the students receive free or reduced lunch under the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/1751">42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.</external-xref>), was once threatened with closure. Oyler Elementary School has achieved more than its expected level of growth for more than 2 consecutive years. The school’s performance index has improved by 6 percent in the last 2 years alone.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H37494F5711D4492EA6DB92F2FE736DE7"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In Providence, Rhode Island, results from Bailey Elementary School, the first full-service community school in the State, are positive. In 2009, Bailey Elementary School made adequate yearly progress in both mathematics and reading for the first time in 4 years. In reading, students in grade 3 went from scoring 27 percent proficiency in 2007 to 41 percent in 2009, scores for students in grade 4 jumped from 28 percent proficiency to 59 percent during the same period, and students in grade 5 moved from 12 percent proficiency to 39 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="H46EBD75A080F4BF7A19322222CDC898A"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The Evansville Vanderburgh School Corporation (EVSC) in Evansville, Indiana, is a districtwide community school system that serves over 22,000 students in 38 schools. Students are connected to their schools and to helping institutions like churches and community organizations, libraries and health clinics, recreation centers and volunteer agencies, all of which allow students to explore and participate in the larger community.</text>
