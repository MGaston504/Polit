 <paragraph id="H8A85EB8C5C6A41A6AA711A28F7F5B5D6"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">An inequity of voting rights exists in the United States because voters in some States have the universal right to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HBBEEC86BC4E54B8FBA80D1EB72341699"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Many voters often have work, family, or other commitments that make getting to polls on the date of an election difficult or impossible. Under current State laws, many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8724157CC28046F99143DD614895F1D5"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Twenty-nine States and the District of Columbia currently allow universal absentee voting (also known as <quote>no-excuse</quote> absentee voting), which permits any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a reason for the request, and no State which has implemented no-excuse absentee voting has switched back.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2C77D3FFAB0E4F9791B1A3B77F44614E"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their choices, which is especially important as many ballots contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative and referendum process in many States.</text>

Voting by mail has become increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that they are able to vote no matter what comes up on Election Day.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9EB889F479494B6487597B1EBA0D2B94"><enum>(8)</enum><text>No evidence exists suggesting the potential for fraud in absentee balloting is greater than the potential for fraud by any other method of voting.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HAC3339C8AD354544A66ED2D0A011544F"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Many of the reasons which voters in many States are required to provide in order to vote by mail require the revelation of personal information about health, travel plans, or religious activities, which violate votersâ€™ privacy while doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.</text>
