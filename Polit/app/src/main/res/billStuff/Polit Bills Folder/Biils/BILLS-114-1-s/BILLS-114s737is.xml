Without Medicaid coverage, many enrollees would be uninsured or lack coverage for services they need.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idb6bb931665ce4478b782ceb998531c58"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In 2014, the Medicaid program covered 69,000,000 individuals, or 1 in every 5 Americans. This number will continue to grow, particularly since the Affordable Care Act significantly expanded eligibility to millions of uninsured adults.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="id1ddab97ccd8b46f68f2fe9fd819bc97a"><enum>(5)</enum><text>In 47 States and in the District of Columbia, Medicaid pays up to 67 percent less than Medicare for the same primary care services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id92f607c7427d4a59a2b3862d70179b90"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Congress has recognized that low provider participation in Medicaid decreases access to health care. To address this problem, Congress acted to increase Medicaid payments for certain primary care services to be not less than the Medicare payment rates for 2013 and 2014.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3f3575b36b5040468d95649241cd2e51"><enum>(7)</enum><text>As more Americans become insured and empowered participants in their own health care, demand for primary care services is expected to increase over the next few years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idBBC4AB41B9094F31AC611388E1704421"><enum>(8)</enum><text>According to a study published earlier this year in the New England Journal of Medicine, higher Medicaid payment rates have significantly increased appointment availability for Medicaid enrollees.</text>

They are more likely to see their OB/GYN physician on a regular basis than any other type of provider. Given that women comprise the majority of Medicaid enrollees, it is critical that primary care providers, including OB/GYN physicians, receive sufficient reimbursement to participate in Medicaid.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idf8e22484f6254a8aa424754bd302d256"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Nurse practitioners and other health professionals deliver many primary care services. Applying Medicare’s rates for nurse practitioners and other health professionals encourages greater participation in Medicaid, thereby increasing access to primary care, particularly in underserved areas.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id14f0249c8ad844979655b2207f7fa174"><enum>(11)</enum><text>The enhanced Medicaid reimbursement rate ensures providers have the financial capability to serve their patients’ primary care needs. Furthermore, adding nurse practitioners, physician assistants, certified nurse-midwives, and OB/GYN physicians serving in primary care settings increases access to critical health care services for women and children nationwide.</text>
