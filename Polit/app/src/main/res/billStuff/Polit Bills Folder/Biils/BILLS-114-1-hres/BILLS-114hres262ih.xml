 <whereas><text>Whereas promoting trust between law enforcement agencies and the communities they serve is critical to the stability of our communities, the integrity of our criminal justice system, and the safe and effective delivery of law enforcement services;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas events in Ferguson, Missouri; Staten Island, New York; North Charleston, South Carolina; Baltimore, Maryland, and other cities across the country have highlighted the need for strong, collaborative relationships between local police and the communities they serve and protect;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on December 18, 2014, President Barack Obama signed Executive Order 13684 to establish the Task Force on 21st Century Policing to examine how to establish effective crime prevention strategies while also building public trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Task Force recommended that law enforcement agencies engage in proven and successful community-policing tactics, such as combining a focus on intervention and prevention through problem solving and collaborative partnerships with schools, social services, and other stakeholders;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Task Force also recommended law enforcement departments should strive to increase the diversity of their workforce;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the most recent period where statistics are available, the Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 4,813 deaths occurred during or shortly after law enforcement personnel attempted to arrest or restrain a suspect, demonstrating the urgency to act on implementing the recommendations in the report;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to a 2007 survey by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, only 16 percent of police departments, employing 48 percent of officers, across the country had a formal written community-policing plan;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress recognizes the vital role and practice that community-oriented policing plays in building trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve and protect;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a September 2014 study published in The New York Times, found that of hundreds of police departments across the United States, the percentage of Whites on the force is more than thirty percentage points higher than in the communities they serve;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a 2007 survey conducted by the Bureau of Justice Statistics on law enforcement agencies in the United States found that only 1 in 4 local police officers was a member of a racial or ethnic minority, and that only 1 in 8 local police officers was a woman;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress recognizes that hiring and retaining law enforcement officers that are more reflective of the community’s racial and gender makeup it serves and protects is critical to building trust between communities and law enforcement;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since its inception, the Community Oriented Policing Services Program (COPS) Office has invested approximately $14.7 billion to add officers to the Nation’s streets, enhance crime fighting technology, support crime prevention initiatives, and provide training and technical assistance to help advance community policing; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress recognizes the critical role of the COPS Hiring Program Office in expanding the practice of community-oriented policing to law enforcement departments: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
