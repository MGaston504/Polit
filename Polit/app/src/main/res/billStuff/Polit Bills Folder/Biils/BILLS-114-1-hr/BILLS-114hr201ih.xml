			 recreation systems in America’s metropolitan areas.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H31F238E547E0415D995383F50201C868"><enum>(3)</enum><text>According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, parks, beaches, and other recreational
			 facilities contribute $730 billion per year to the U.S. economy, support
			 nearly 6.5 million jobs, and contribute to cleaner air and water and
			 higher property values.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H4BCA2FEE06244F1D92CF99B5EC40D03B"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Despite spending on parks at the State and local level, the acreage of parkland per resident in
			 urban areas is declining due to rapid increases in population.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HAA44731660484E90931EDF204A2B9AC1"><enum>(5)</enum><text>A lack of access to public parks and recreation areas and facilities, as well as deteriorating and
			 unsafe play areas, leads to an increase in physical inactivity, which in
			 turn contributes to higher rates of obesity.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HCC6553957ECD466E913124D6EDC51AD6"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, over the past 25 years, rates of
			 obesity have more than tripled among adolescents ages 12 to 19 and doubled
			 among adults ages 20 to 74 and children ages 6 to 11.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H2D41F44B2FDB48E89ABEE92E84D4041D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Obesity and related health problems put a strain on our Nation’s economy, as the annual costs of
			 medical spending and lost productivity from individuals in the United
			 States being obese and overweight are estimated to be $147,000,000,000.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H76A1F23D635249079C4184D8F05700ED"><enum>(8)</enum><text>A study by the Centers for Disease Control found that the creation of, or enhanced access to,
			 places for physical activity, such as parks, led to a 25.6 percent
			 increase in the percentage of people exercising on 3 or more days a week,
			 which improves the physical and mental health of our citizens.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HE650C65431F849F4A00CE08538769FC5"><enum>(9)</enum><text>There are nearly 23 million veterans in the United States. Many have mental and physical

			 Afghanistan.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H52826772FC504B51A2CB4E2355E0817D"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Parks and recreation agencies are providing vital programs for veterans, with and without

			 social benefits to improve their overall quality of life as they
			 transition to civilian living.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="H28F736A76E4148F383B874F5F8D53B35"><enum>(11)</enum><text>According to the Juvenile Justice Bulletin, without structured, supervised activities in the
			 after-school hours, youth are at greater risk of being victims of crime or
			 participating in anti-social behaviors between 2:00 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. The
			 peak hour for juvenile crime is between 3:00 p.m. and 4:00 p.m., the first
			 hour after most students are dismissed from school. Urban parks decrease
			 juvenile delinquency by providing quality after-school programs during
			 these critical hours.</text>

			 billions of dollars on treatment of storm water runoff and air pollution,
			 studies have shown that parkland saves cities millions of dollars in storm
			 water management and air pollution expenses by capturing precipitation,
			 reducing runoff, and absorbing air pollutants.</text>
