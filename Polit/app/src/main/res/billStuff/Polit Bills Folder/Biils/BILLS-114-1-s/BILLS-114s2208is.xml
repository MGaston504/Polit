 <paragraph id="id122178cff25c4eeeabc20056597c6335"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Violence against women has been reported as the leading cause of physical injury to women. Such violence has a devastating impact on women’s physical and emotional health, financial security, and ability to maintain their jobs, and thus impacts interstate commerce and economic security.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ide694f91ff3284f849e36215ecf9ab6e6"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Office on Violence Against Women of the Department of Justice defines domestic violence as a pattern of abusive behavior in any relationship that is used by one intimate partner to gain or maintain power and control over another intimate partner. Domestic violence can be physical, sexual, emotional, economic, or psychological actions or threats of actions that influence another person. Domestic violence includes any behaviors that intimidate, manipulate, humiliate, isolate, frighten, terrorize, coerce, threaten, blame, hurt, injure, or wound an individual.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id21a2d10409774af2a86daa6595add911"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that domestic violence or intimate partner violence is a serious public health issue for millions of individuals in the United States. Nearly one in four women and one in seven men in the United States have suffered severe physical violence by an intimate partner.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idd8ac59dc2d81444b9557adf5f5d7d0e2"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Homicide is the leading cause of death for women on the job. Husbands, boyfriends, and ex-partners commit 15 percent of workplace homicides against women. One study found that intimate partner violence resulted in 142 homicides among women at work in the United States from 2003 to 2008, a figure which represents 22 percent of the 648 workplace homicides among women during the period. In fact, in 2010, homicides against women at work increased by 13 percent despite continuous declines in overall workplace homicides in recent years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3df7934f051b4ed7aec57969a077a8e1"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Women in the United States are 11 times more likely to be murdered with guns than women in other high-income countries. Female intimate partners are more likely to be murdered with a firearm than all other means combined. The presence of a gun in domestic violence situations increases the risk of homicide for women by 500 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ideeb10a94addc4eadb09ca5ed41aef944"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Violence can have a dramatic impact on the survivor of such violence. Studies indicate that between 35 and 56 percent of employed survivors of domestic violence who are women were harassed at work by their abusive partners. More than 35 percent of stalking survivors report losing time from work due to the stalking and seven percent of such survivors never return to work. Sexual assault, whether occurring in or out of the workplace, can impair an employee’s work performance, require time away from work, and undermine the employee’s ability to maintain a job. Nearly 50 percent of sexual assault survivors lose their jobs or are forced to quit in the aftermath of the assaults.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id69a112d962f6402eb1ab202510ac8540"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Studies find that 60 percent of single women lack economic security and 81 percent of households with single mothers live in economic insecurity. Research shows that expenses such as housing, transportation, and child care are often cited as the most significant barriers that survivors confront when attempting to escape violence or rebuild their lives. Survivors are deprived of their autonomy, liberty, and security, and face tremendous threats to their health and safety.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idb8b03bf0963e4440ac5b1794c07c7900"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that survivors of severe intimate partner violence lose nearly 8,000,000 days of paid work, which is the equivalent of more than 32,000 full-time jobs and almost 5,600,000 days of household productivity each year. Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to find safety solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent further violence.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id8e6d19df514441ebb931e9d72b2b0569"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the costs of intimate partner violence against women in 1995 exceeded an estimated $5,800,000,000. These costs included nearly $4,100,000,000 in the direct costs of medical and mental health care and nearly $1,800,000,000 in the indirect costs of lost productivity. These statistics are generally considered to be underestimated because the costs associated with the criminal justice system are not included.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id08a2d144ae7f4487943f8f2c776c1ce5"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Fifty-five percent of senior executives recently surveyed said domestic violence has a harmful effect on their company’s productivity, and more than 70 percent said domestic violence negatively affects attendance. Seventy-eight percent of human resources professionals consider partner violence a workplace issue. However, more than 70 percent of United States workplaces have no formal program or policy that addresses workplace violence, let alone domestic violence. In fact, only four percent of employers provided training on domestic violence.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id649d10e8b0dd48619ccebaec2e9ac596"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Studies indicate that one of the best predictors of whether a survivor will be able to stay away from his or her abuser is the degree of his or her economic independence. However, domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking often negatively impact a survivor’s ability to maintain employment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id11bb9e3b76a24db3870491167adc570d"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Abusers frequently seek to exert financial control over their partners by actively interfering with their ability to work, including preventing their partners from going to work, harassing their partners at work, limiting their partners’ access to cash or transportation, and sabotaging their partners’ child care arrangements.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id1dc7ab7d393e48d79754fb524c3c8447"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>), and the amendments made by such Act, ensures that most health plans must cover preventive services, including screening and counseling for domestic violence, at no additional cost. In addition, it prohibits insurance companies from discriminating against patients for preexisting conditions, like domestic violence.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id2e8c002a12784c4bb17f8035e53d4540"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Yet, more can be done to help survivors. Federal law in effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act does not explicitly—</text>
 <subparagraph id="id2f5bf62e60dc4411825837847666031f"><enum>(A)</enum><text>authorize survivors of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to take leave from work to seek legal assistance and redress, counseling, or assistance with safety planning activities;</text>
