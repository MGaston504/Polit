 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCAA4BED691644EF9BEDFFF615723B754"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Neither a woman’s income level nor her type of insurance should prevent her from having access to a full range of pregnancy-related care, including abortion services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB34D41E5449944DE823DAF5DD5F10919"><enum>(3)</enum><text>No woman should have the decision to have, or not to have, an abortion made for her based on her ability or inability to afford the procedure.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEDAC9F8C640148E8998B2DDAB558D272"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Since 1976, the Federal Government has withheld funds for abortion coverage in most circumstances. As a 2013 analysis by the Guttmacher Institute shows, this affects women of reproductive age in the United States who are insured through the Medicaid program, as well as women who receive insurance or care through other Federal health plans and programs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H710885490CB84556BC85DE2CE075F41B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Moreover, 25 States also prohibit abortion coverage in private insurance plans within or beyond health insurance marketplaces under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, according to an analysis of State policies by the Guttmacher Institute.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H103CD9AB2F19496F8EBDB5C6B1825D7C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>A report by the Center for Reproductive Rights details how restrictions on abortion coverage interfere with a woman’s personal decisionmaking, with her health and well-being, and with her constitutionally protected right to a safe and legal medical procedure.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H31066E666D494AFAB197FDE876BFE26F"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Restrictions on abortion coverage have a disproportionate impact on low-income women, women of color, immigrant women, and young women, according to reports by both the Center for American Progress and the Guttmacher Institute. Also according to the reports, these women are already disadvantaged in their access to the resources, information, and services necessary to prevent an unintended pregnancy or to carry a healthy pregnancy to term.</text>
