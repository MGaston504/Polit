 <whereas><text>Whereas military caregivers are nameless, courageous, giving individuals whose determination and sacrifices are rarely acknowledged and little known outside of the military community;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a military caregiver can be identified as a father, mother, spouse, sibling, family member, or loved one of a member of the uniformed services or veteran who provides medical care to the member or veteran suffering from a physical, mental, or emotional wound or injury;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since the first armed conflict of the United States, uniformed service members have gone home after combat to be cared for by family members and loved-ones;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has always had caregivers since the War of Independence to the Civil War and now attending to veterans as they recover from seen and unseen wounds from combat operations;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas military caregivers have shown time and time again, regardless of the conflict, that caring for those who return home is a part of the character of the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas many of the members and veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom suffered such wounds or injuries and require assistance from a caregiver to complete activities of daily living such as bathing, dressing, and feeding, or instrumental activities such as transportation, meal preparation, and health management;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, as many as 1,000,000 spouses, parents, and children of veterans have served or are currently serving as family caregivers to veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom, according to a study of military caregivers conducted by the RAND Corporation;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas section 1672 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/110/181">Public Law 110–181</external-xref>; <external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/10/1071">10 U.S.C. 1071</external-xref> note) introduced an expansion of medical care available to family caregivers, and the Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of 2010 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/163">Public Law 111–163</external-xref>) facilitated a new program for access to health insurance, mental health services, caregiver training, and respite care by family caregivers of veterans who served in Operation Enduring Freedom or Operation Iraqi Freedom;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the love and loyalty of military caregivers endures through the hardships of extended hospital stays, multiple surgeries, and lifetimes of care and helps create a fresh start that is hopeful even during difficult times;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the daisy is a flower that symbolizes both loyalty to love and new beginnings; and</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there is no more appropriate representation of the devotion and determination to overcome obstacles shown every day by military caregivers than the daisy: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
