 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Lyndon B. Johnson established the President’s Commission on White House Fellowships, through Executive Order 11183 (as amended) to create a program that would select between 11 and 19 outstanding young Americans every year and bring them to Washington for a <quote>first hand, high-level experience in the workings of the Federal Government, to establish an era when the young men and women of America and their government belonged to each other – belonged to each other in fact and in spirit</quote>;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas this legacy of leadership is a national resource that has served the Nation in major challenges, including organizing resettlement operations following the Vietnam War, assisting with the national response to terrorist attacks, managing the aftermath of natural disasters such as Hurricane Katrina and Rita, providing support to earthquake victims in Haiti and Nepal, performing military service in Iraq and Afghanistan, and reforming and innovating in national and international securities and capital markets;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the 738 White House Fellows have characterized their post-Fellowship years with a demonstrable lifetime commitment to public service through continuing personal and professional renewal and association, creating a White House Fellows Community of Mutual Support for leadership at every level of government and in every element of our national life; and</text>
