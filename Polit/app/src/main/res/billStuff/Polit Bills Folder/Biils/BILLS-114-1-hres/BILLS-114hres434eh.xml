<paragraph id="HB194011CC66341ADAEA317DFCADFFDE6"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H415AD8FF5F1B4C52861BB05936E9900D"><enum>(2)</enum><text>According to the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law enforcement officers under TSA policy and receive premium pay.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H2B81250FB0B3486CB6C66FFADBC7BD74"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which the DHS IG asserts could be performed by employees other than criminal investigators at a lower cost.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4606E3E4ADFB46F3A6A2B664E17819ED"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much as $17 million over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection, according to the DHS IG.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HCF999F37DA1D452A80AECC4803759F3D"><enum>(5)</enum><text>This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.</text></paragraph></section> <section id="HC53B5AD3EDC2481083164B6168A2AED3"><enum>3.</enum><header>Definitions</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">In this Act:</text>
