 <whereas><text>Whereas there is strong bipartisan agreement that the Federal spending mechanism known as <quote>sequestration</quote> is severely impeding Congress’ ability to properly budget;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there is strong bipartisan agreement that the cuts now in effect as a result of sequestration are severe, and will cause even greater harm if allowed to continue into fiscal year 2016;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there is strong bipartisan agreement that the harm sequestration is doing to national defense, in particular, is grave and unacceptable, especially given that external threats are increasing worldwide;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sequestration is a result of the failure of the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, established by the Budget Control Act, to reach a principled compromise;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sequestration will continue to distort the budget process into fiscal year 2016 unless legislation is passed by Congress and signed into law by President Obama that would restore allocation levels;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Budget Control Act was signed into law on August 2, 2011, and sequestration went into effect on March 1, 2013;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Ryan-Murray agreement provided a short-term increase of the budget caps through September 30, 2015;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas only 12 legislative days for the House of Representatives and 15 legislative days for the Senate are tentatively scheduled in September, prior to the end of fiscal year 2015;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress has not considered any proposals during the 114th Congress that would alter or replace the statutory caps required by sequestration; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas our system of governance does not function without a willingness of a majority of Members of the House of Representatives and Senators to vote for a principled compromise based on sound policy, empirical data, and fact-driven projections: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
