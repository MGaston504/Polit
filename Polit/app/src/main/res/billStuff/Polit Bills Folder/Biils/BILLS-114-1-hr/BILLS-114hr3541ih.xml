 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFDBCC65BC64B4AAC8EAC237CBAF825B3"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Such widening disparities are unhealthy for our democracy and unhealthy for the broad swath of working families who are unable to afford to pay their rent or buy a home, save for their children’s higher education, or afford the basic necessities to live a dignified and full life.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H26004B3CF5CD4DD495336272388936EB"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">One major factor contributing to this growing economic crisis has been the lack of full employment in the economy of the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0F415AB5CBBD4ABBA159D93F3689D680"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Too many workers struggle to find jobs, and the jobs that are available often do not pay a good wage.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H49A09B7A6A324E8AB2B83A510AAB7867"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In the absence of a tight labor market and genuine full employment, workers are at the mercy of their employers and cannot ask for raises or leave for better job opportunities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H46CAE0BCFCB24492833047AFB06D9901"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">As a result of workers’ decreased bargaining power, corporate profits and executive compensation have accounted for an increasingly large share of gross domestic product, leaving the large majority of workers in the United States behind.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H22A838BD1C724EE2AAB706F62496D32B"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Since 1980, the economy of the United States has had an excessively high level of unemployment 70 percent of the time, according to the Congressional Budget Office’s official estimate of full employment (that is, the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment, or <quote>NAIRU</quote>).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97BF0D8C6AFC4EE7952E1C8D90AA70AF"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">This contrasts with the 1949–1979 era, when the economy of the United States was functioning below full employment only 31 percent of the time.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H22C74385FBF44DF4B7BC525219F6E816"><enum>(11)</enum><text>This persistently weak labor market has had tremendous consequences not only for the unemployed and underemployed, but also for employed workers who have been unable to negotiate for higher wages and better working conditions, including the following examples:</text>
 <subparagraph id="H32699659854C40DEA77F8643384906E3"><enum>(A)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Since 1979, although economy-wide productivity has grown by 64.3 percent, women’s median wages have risen by only 20.6 percent and men’s median wages have actually fallen by 8.9 percent, and the statistics for Black and Hispanic workers are even worse than for White workers.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="HFEDFF626234E4FF0AD6D370CB90F6CB7"><enum>(B)</enum><text>Workers’ share of corporate income has shrunk significantly, from 82.3 percent during the full employment economy of 2000 to 75.5 percent today, a decline that means that workers will earn $535 billion less this year than they would have had the share remained stable, or approximately $3,770 per worker this year.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="HB0AADFFB84B44C278A1C772B2749E773"><enum>(C)</enum><text>Between 2002 and 2014, inflation-adjusted hourly wages for the bottom seven deciles (that is, 70 percent of the workforce of the United States) fell, showing that wage stagnation is not limited to low-income families.</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="HC22517E2B47045F4A386DDB555C0C2D4"><enum>(D)</enum><text>Even highly educated workers are not thriving in this economy; wages for college-educated and advanced-degree workers fell in 2013 and 2014, a time of economic growth for the economy at large.</text>
 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H5D6D0F511B5448ABBB0642CF77D88DB1"><enum>(12)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Congress has mandated that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System pursue a dual mandate of <quote>maximum employment</quote> and <quote>stable prices</quote>, which the Board of Governors has interpreted to mean full employment that is consistent with an inflation rate of 2 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF158545CD3304569879414090BEEFC37"><enum>(13)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Since the Great Recession, the economy of the United States has consistently had an unemployment rate higher than the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System’s NAIRU and an inflation rate below the 2-percent target; consistently missing both targets has caused untold harm to hundreds of millions of people.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H03B5CE9E12ED4A6F888562358A91FDAE"><enum>(14)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Today’s headline unemployment rate understates the continued weakness of the economy of the United States, including the following examples:</text>

 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H4FDD048B95C24A16AB9C3DCD21E7BBFE"><enum>(C)</enum><text>The portion of prime-age adults who are in the labor force remains depressed, because so many millions of people have given up looking for work.</text>
 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HEA374F7108C440A1AB50C2AACC777969"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Although there is no empirical evidence that an inflation rate of 3 or 4 percent would be harmful, or would be difficult to maintain at a stable rate, many observers believe that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System actually treats its 2-percent inflation target as a ceiling.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H1AD28FD851364E69AEEFE47F520E91B1"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Over recent decades and even today, refusal by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System to tolerate any inflation means that it has consistently raised interest rates prematurely during recoveries, preventing the economy from reaching full employment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFBE00BB393AF4109832B82D27680D6AC"><enum>(17)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Inflation remains below the already conservative 2-percent target of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and shows no signs of accelerating uncontrollably.</text>

 <subparagraph id="H53C18421DA2947E6B1B13249A0240406"><enum>(A)</enum><text>higher wages for everyone, including those at the bottom of the income ladder;</text> </subparagraph><subparagraph id="HDF9C0CF0027D427682F17FDD903F7DAE"><enum>(B)</enum><text>robust wage gains for African-Americans and Hispanics, which shrank the tremendous racial disparities in pay and wealth; and</text>
 </subparagraph><subparagraph id="H3A8B3BF80D2645A2A59202DF773247AB"><enum>(C)</enum><text>a large Federal budget surplus (and State budget surpluses), which meant money was available for key services like education, health care, and infrastructure investment.</text>
 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HF388D6533B0443418A85D7D5519A4039"><enum>(19)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">One key reason that the economy approached full employment was that the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System resisted pressures to raise interest rates and let the unemployment rate continue to fall.</text>
