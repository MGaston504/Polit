 </paragraph><paragraph id="H43EA14B39C0647F8BF3D183DFA0ADF90"><enum>(2)</enum><text>It is widely believed by ecologists, wildlife scientists, public land specialists, and other experts that the wilderness ecosystem centered around and dependent upon the Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska, represents the very epitome of a primeval wilderness ecosystem and constitutes the greatest wilderness area and diversity of wildlife habitats of its kind in the United States.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8A5173CFEBC9497FB7171258032A377A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>President Dwight D. Eisenhower initiated protection of the wilderness values of the Arctic coastal plain in 1960 when he set aside 8,900,000 acres establishing the Arctic National Wildlife Range expressly <quote>for the purpose of preserving unique wildlife, wilderness and recreational values</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8B23901C5BEF4F6C80CD97D28FA35C2D"><enum>(4)</enum><text>In 1980, when the Congress acted to strengthen the protective management of the Eisenhower-designated area with the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/96/487">Public Law 96–487</external-xref>), Representative Morris K. Udall led the effort to more than double the size of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and extend statutory wilderness protection to most of the original area.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H245C992484754295B84C0971F7DD3956"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Before the enactment of the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, the House of Representatives twice passed legislation that would have protected the entire Eisenhower-designated area as wilderness, including the Arctic coastal plain.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H840854EC6FD847B8802031323489E196"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Canada has taken action to preserve those portions of the wilderness ecosystem of the Arctic that exist on its side of the international border and provides strong legal protection for the habitat of the Porcupine River caribou herd that migrates annually through both countries to calve on the Arctic coastal plain.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H14A238395C344EA8A30AA32C645E1DB3"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The extension of full wilderness protection for the Arctic coastal plain within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge will still leave most of the North Slope of Alaska available for the development of energy resources, which will allow Alaska to continue to contribute significantly to meeting the energy needs of the United States without despoiling the unique Arctic coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.</text>
