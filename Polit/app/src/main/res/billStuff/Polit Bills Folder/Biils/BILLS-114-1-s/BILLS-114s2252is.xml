 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Congress makes the following findings:</text>
				<paragraph id="HDC017D826294453DB1FBA717234AE174">
					<enum>(1)</enum>
 <text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 1978, Congress was concerned that lack of clarity as to the proper classification of some workers, increased IRS enforcement activity, and retroactive application by IRS of interpretations that were arguably new had caused hardships for some small businesses and other taxpayers and confusion as to the applicable rules.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HA2194778E34B4EE7A014E4C00B11E6B9">
					<enum>(2)</enum>
 <text>To allow time to develop a comprehensive approach to the problem, Congress enacted section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 as an interim measure protecting taxpayers from liability for misclassification if the taxpayer has a reasonable basis for classifying a worker as an independent contractor and meets certain other conditions. In addition, the Act prohibited the Secretary of the Treasury from publishing regulations or revenue rulings on workers’ employment tax status pending the expected near-term enactment of clarifying legislation.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HF280B886EC324D3EA1EAC2912BD36EB2">
					<enum>(3)</enum>
 <text>During the ensuing 33 years, Congress made section 530 of the Revenue Act of 1978 permanent; however, changes in working relationships and the continued prohibition on new guidance have increased the uncertainty as to the proper classification of workers.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HB6D4064B67084B9FB2D75E0A7D5D95F4">
					<enum>(4)</enum>
 <text>Many workers are properly classified as independent contractors. In other instances, workers who are employees are being treated as independent contractors. Such misclassification for tax purposes contributes to inequities in the competitive positions of businesses and to the Federal and State tax gap, and may also result in misclassification for other purposes, such as denial of unemployment benefits, workplace health and safety protections, and retirement or other benefits or protections available to employees.</text>
				</paragraph><paragraph id="HCEA015EA6FC0467D82C38D4CF38E8646">
					<enum>(5)</enum>
 <text>Workers, businesses, and other taxpayers will benefit from clear guidance regarding employment tax status. In the interest of fairness and in view of many service recipients’ reliance on current section 530, such guidance should apply only prospectively.</text>
