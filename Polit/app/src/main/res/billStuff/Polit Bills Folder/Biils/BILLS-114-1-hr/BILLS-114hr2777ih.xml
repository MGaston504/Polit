 <paragraph id="HE1C592AA59B04BA7B4CE14C6A7B3DE13"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Individuals can commit various types of fraud against the Government by reporting earnings under deceased individuals’ Social Security Numbers (SSNs).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE002CD5845D24CCF86FA9E90F83628AB"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Various Federal entities rely on the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) death information to detect unreported deaths and verify the accuracy of reported deaths.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9DE2F0DE1B6344339EAC4C86AA32579A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The Numident is the SSA’s computer database file on all who have applied for a Social Security number. The Office of the Inspector General (OIG) of the SSA conducted an audit and determined that the SSA did not have controls in place to annotate death information on the Numident records of numberholders who exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies and were likely deceased.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF3942BE5A3A84F63A4BA07CCBB8043E4"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The OIG identified approximately 6.5 million numberholders age 112 or older who did not have death information on the Numident.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6864C2A4A63A4138840CD0C1A967543C"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The OIG identified 34 cases in which it appeared that the deceased numberholder’s name and Social Security Number (SSN) had been misused. In one instance an employer reported paying wages to someone from 2008 through 2012 using a numberholder’s name and SSN that had been born in 1886. SSA payment records indicated that the numberholder died in January 1965, but the SSA did not record the numberholder’s death on the Numident. SSA continued paying benefits to the numberholder’s widow until her death in February 1973. SSA’s Master Earning File (MEF) contained no reported earnings information for this numberholder from 1956 through 2007.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3F8EC2B482724948ABF27865FB984E05"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The OIG determined that thousands of the SSNs could have been used to commit identity fraud. For tax years 2006 through 2011, SSA received reports that individuals using 66,920 SSNs had approximately $3.1 billion in wages, tips, and self-employment income. SSA transferred the earnings to the Earnings Suspense File because the employees’ or self-employed individuals’ names on the earnings reports did not match the numberholders’ names.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H58C1919314A54A2E87FBC012D8542680"><enum>(7)</enum><text>During calendar years 2008 through 2011, employers made 4,024 E-Verify inquiries using 3,873 SSNs belonging to numberholders born before June 16, 1901. According to the OIG, these inquiries indicate individuals’ attempts to use the SSNs to apply for work.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEC620AFA4BB84033A9865DF6A53D9763"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The OIG determined that resolving these discrepancies will improve the accuracy and completeness of the Death Master File and help prevent future misuse of these SSNs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H829A691A687E49C385F6C7C3B9FCDB15"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The American taxpayer deserves to have the surety of knowing that every agency and department within the Federal Government takes the prudent actions necessary to prevent future fraud and waste of hard-earned dollars.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF485242EE33B4956BC835B1BE4F36699"><enum>(10)</enum><text>In line with the OIG’s recommendations, the SSA should take proactive action to protect the American taxpayer by ensuring that there are controls in place to annotate death information on the Numident records of numberholders who exceeded maximum reasonable life expectancies.</text>
