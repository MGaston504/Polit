 <whereas><text>Whereas the United States consumes roughly an average of 19,050,000 barrels of oil per day;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the global average of daily oil consumption stands at 92,000,000 barrels of oil per day;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States total annual energy consumption is approximately 97.5 quadrillion BTU, with the global total annual energy consumption at 520 quadrillion BTU;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has greatly increased domestic oil production over the last decade leading to net imports of petroleum decreasing to 27 percent, the lowest number since 1985;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has seen natural gas reserves and production exceed all estimates and due to this is expected to be a net exporter of natural gas by 2016;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States has abundant coal reserves, including a demonstrated reserve base estimated to contain 480 billion short tons, and processes such as gasification and liquefaction offer cleaner alternatives for utilizing this resource;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas renewable sources of energy account for 9.3 quadrillion BTU per year in the United States; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas such sources such as biomass, geothermal, hydropower, nuclear, solar, and wind need and deserve our attention and the necessary resources to encourage their commercial viability: Now, therefore, be it</text>
