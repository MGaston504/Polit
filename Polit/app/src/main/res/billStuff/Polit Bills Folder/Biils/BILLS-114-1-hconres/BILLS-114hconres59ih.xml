<whereas><text>Whereas on average in 2010, 1 child under the age of 15 died every 6 days due to the unintentional discharge of a firearm;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2012, approximately 667 children sustained nonfatal injuries from the unintentional discharge of a firearm;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas in States that collect data through the National Violent Death Reporting System, on average, 80 percent of unintentional firearm deaths of children under 15 occurred in a home;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the ASK Campaign encourages parents to add one more question to a conversation before their child visits other homes, “Is there an unlocked gun in your house?”;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas the ASK Campaign was first established by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the Center to Prevent Youth Violence along with other partners in 2000;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas the President of the AAP has said “keeping children and teens safe from preventable injuries is one of the most important things we do as pediatricians”;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas according to the National Rifle Association’s Parents Guide to Gun Safety, “Parental responsibility does not end, however, when the child leaves the home … Even if no one in your family owns a gun, chances are that someone you know does. Your child could come in contact with a gun at a neighbor’s house, when playing with friends, or under other circumstances outside your home”;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas asking this simple question about gun safety before sending your child to play at another home could help save your child’s life;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas June 21, the first day of summer, the season in which kids typically spend more time at a friend’s or family member’s home, has traditionally been designated as National ASK Day; and</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas June 21, 2015, has been designated by national organizations as the 15th annual National ASK Day: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
