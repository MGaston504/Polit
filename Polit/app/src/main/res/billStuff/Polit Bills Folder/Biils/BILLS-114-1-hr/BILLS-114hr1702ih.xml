 <paragraph id="H39BC1652BEDF402F9E0C69C553E5B316"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Federal law enforcement officers are never <quote>off-duty</quote>. They are counted on to respond at any time of the day or night, regardless of their official duty status, to protect the public safety. Outside of our Nation’s armed forces, theirs is the only occupation comprised of individuals who are routinely called upon to put their lives on the line to keep America safe.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0C43F147F1EE49C4BAE3AB1C372664CF"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Though the Federal Government may house the largest variety of occupations of any U.S. employer across its panoply of agencies and entities, Federal law enforcement is absolutely unique among them, and the Federal law enforcement officer has no counterpart in the private sector. It is one of the most stressful, most dangerous, and most rewarding careers for those who meet the rigorous requirements of the job.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4F4C14805AEB49BFBFBC3C8E1A27202A"><enum>(3)</enum><text>It was in recognition of the unique nature of the occupation, and the demanding schedules required of those who fill its ranks, that Congress established distinct pay and benefit systems for Federal law enforcement positions. This includes basic pay, retirement, and even overtime compensation, in the form of either Law Enforcement Availability Pay (<quote>LEAP</quote>) or Administratively Uncontrollable Overtime (<quote>AUO</quote>).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H228D9F4209B9476291DD13E658766C01"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Under current law, LEAP by its very nature is provided to law enforcement officers to ensure that they are <quote>available</quote>, that they will be <quote>generally and reasonably accessible by the agency</quote> in excess of the 40-hour workweek to perform unscheduled duty based on the agency’s needs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD03B4A151A9F4A75824D05C5F6E6B156"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Similarly, AUO was established to provide overtime to certain law enforcement officers in positions where <quote>the hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively</quote> and that require <quote>substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4AD5D86CE9DD4FE3BCA9045ECD82140E"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Because both LEAP and AUO compensation are subject to the pay caps, they are payable to a Federal law enforcement officer only to the extent that the payments do not cause the aggregate of the employee’s basic pay and premium pay to exceed the established caps.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC359E71E9F174315AB8EB90D34741D43"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In light of the continuing homeland and national security threats facing our Nation, and after a three-year Federal pay freeze, it is in the interest of the Federal Government to ensure that it can continue to recruit and retain the highest caliber personnel by guaranteeing Federal law enforcement officers full credit in retirement for overtime hours worked but never paid.</text>
