 </paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent home;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas nearly 255,000 youth entered the foster care system in 2013, while more than 101,000 youth were eligible for and awaiting adoption at the end of 2013;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas children of minority races and ethnicities are more likely to stay in the foster care system for longer periods of time and are less likely to be reunited with their biological families;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas foster parents—</text> <paragraph id="id75A8B88D7A674FDC9DCF605ED9227343"><enum>(1)</enum><text>are the front-line caregivers for children who cannot safely remain with their biological parents;</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idDEBC757AE68942D890705128360544FD"><enum>(2)</enum><text>provide physical care, emotional support, and education advocacy to the children in their care; and</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas foster care is intended to be a temporary placement, but children remain in the foster care system for an average of 2 years;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas children in foster care experience an average of 3 different placements, which often leads to disruption of routines and the need to change schools and move away from siblings, extended families, and familiar surroundings;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas children entering foster care often confront the widespread misperception that children in foster care are disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though placement in foster care is based on the actions of a parent or guardian, not the child;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas children who age out of foster care lack the security and support of a biological or adoptive family and frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, obtain health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire adequate employment;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas States, localities, and communities should be encouraged to invest resources in preventative and reunification services and postpermanency programs to ensure that more children in foster care are provided with safe, loving, and permanent placements;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas May 2015 is an appropriate month to designate as <quote>National Foster Care Month</quote> to provide an opportunity to acknowledge the accomplishments of the child-welfare workforce, foster parents, the advocacy community, and mentors for their dedication, accomplishments, and positive impact on the lives of children; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
