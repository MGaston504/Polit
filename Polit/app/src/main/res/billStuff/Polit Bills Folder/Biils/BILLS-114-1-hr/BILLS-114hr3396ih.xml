The National Medical Association has worked with the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS (NBLCA) to organize clergy to advocate for the specific needs of Black physicians, their patients, and those at risk in African-American communities. Both organizations have pledged to advocate and work with clergy to develop, execute, and implement these initiatives in African-American communities and culture.</text>

Included in this prestigious gathering were the Health Brain Trust of the Congressional Black Caucus, leaders from the National Conference of Black Mayors, and the National Caucus of Black State Legislators.
