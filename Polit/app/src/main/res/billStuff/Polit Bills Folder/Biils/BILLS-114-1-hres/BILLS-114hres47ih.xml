	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas access to comprehensive reproductive health care is critical to improving the health and well-being of women and their families and is an essential part of their economic security;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas access to affordable contraceptives, including emergency contraceptives, and medically accurate information prevents unintended pregnancies, thereby improving the health of women, children, families, and society as a whole;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), was decided 42 years ago and clarifies that women have a constitutional right to plan their families and futures;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private reproductive health care decisions should be decided by women and their health care providers;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the requirement under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>) that all insurance plans cover contraception without cost sharing has saved women at least $483,000,000, and more than 30,000,000 women are eligible for this benefit;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas research suggests that increasing the rate of contraceptive use may be associated with the decline in teen pregnancy by 50 percent since 1990;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas elected officials in many States and Congress have attempted to block or curtail women’s access to medical care and information in order to fulfill a political agenda, and they have often succeeded in such attempts;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there have been numerous attempts, both legal and legislative, to allow insurance companies and employers to deny women coverage for all contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, even though the law requires such coverage, and such methods are based on a foundation of scientific evidence;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas since the enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, States have enacted hundreds of laws restricting access to women's reproductive health care and 24 States have enacted laws that reduce abortion coverage in plans that are offered through the Exchanges established under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 24 States have laws or policies that interfere with women’s health care providers in a way that undermines, instead of strengthens, patient safety: Now, therefore, be it</text>
