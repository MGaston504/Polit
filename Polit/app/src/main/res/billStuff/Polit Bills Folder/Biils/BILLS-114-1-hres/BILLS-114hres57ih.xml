 <whereas><text>Whereas 2015 will be the 80th anniversary of the promulgation of the Nuremberg laws, which on September 15, 1935, deprived Jews and other <quote>non-Aryans</quote> of German citizenship and discriminated against them in other ways;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Nuremberg laws are remembered as infamous exercises of anti-Semitism and racism as official state policy;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 2015 will be the 70th anniversary of the end of the Holocaust, and more specifically the liberation of Auschwitz, which on January 27, 1945, was liberated by Soviet troops who encountered approximately 7,500 living prisoners;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the liberation of Auschwitz has come to symbolize the end of the Holocaust, as this was the place where at least 1,100,000 people, approximately 90 percent of whom were Jewish, were murdered as a matter of official state policy of Nazi Germany;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 2015 will mark the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Federal Republic of Germany, which occurred on May 12, 1965;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 2015 will be the 50th anniversary of the proclamation of Nostra Aetate (<quote>In Our Time</quote>), the Declaration on the Relationship of the Church to Non-Christian Religions, in which on October 28, 1965, Pope Paul VI made an authoritative declaration on Catholic-Jewish relations and also on Catholic-interfaith relations;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Nostra Aetate condemned anti-Semitism, opened the doors for Catholic-Jewish dialogue and cooperation, has been widely credited as contributing greatly to reversing centuries of misunderstanding between Christians and Jews, and has been a touchstone statement on mutual respect for all religions;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these anniversaries will be widely observed and occasions for reflection by many people in 2015; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the lessons contained in the anniversaries are applicable beyond those nations and faiths involved in the events they mark: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
