 <paragraph id="HEFAA20BC1B964A268367990152D31531"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT) is a largely undiagnosed or misdiagnosed vascular genetic bleeding disorder resulting in artery-vein malformations (AVMs) which lead to preventable catastrophic and disabling consequences. HHT can cause sudden death at any age, unless detected and treated. Early detection, screening, and use of readily available treatment can prevent premature deaths and long-term health complications resulting from HHT. A person with HHT has the tendency to form blood vessels that lack the capillaries between an artery and vein. HHT often results in spontaneous hemorrhage or stroke from brain or lung AVMs. In addition to hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke and brain abscess occur in approximately 30 percent of persons with HHT artery-vein malformations in the lung (due to lack of capillaries between the arterial and venous systems which normally filter out clots and bacteria).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE1E668F536F247FEAB86F0CC41AB3E62"><enum>(2)</enum><text>One in 5,000 American children and adults suffer from HHT.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="H12D49EDB87464143B24E764F94D53B36"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Studies have found an increase in morbidity and mortality rates for individuals who suffer from HHT.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD63D12E4CEDB43B1962E46D94E5A4ADF"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Due to the widespread lack of knowledge, accurate diagnosis, and appropriate intervention, 90 percent of HHT-affected families are at risk for preventable, life-threatening, and disabling medical incidents such as stroke.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H224DB2D63BB24B0F9B1CED0B8A2FC576"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Early detection, screening, and treatment can prevent premature deaths, spontaneous hemorrhage, hemorrhagic stroke, embolic stroke, brain abscess, and other long-term health care complications resulting from HHT.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H045265C7620142759006DAC2BDB9C9EB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>HHT is an important health condition with serious health consequences which are amenable to early identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and acceptable and available treatments in established treatment centers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H08B020AA93154A5E98C4B1DE9540C60A"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Timely identification and management of HHT cases is an important public health objective because it will save lives, prevent disability, and reduce direct and indirect health care costs. A recent study found that use of a genetic testing model for HHT diagnosis saves $9.9 million in that screening can be limited to those persons within the family groups who actually have the gene defect, leading to early intervention in those found to have treatable AVMs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7B26C2B846E74165A49DE60C1FDA627B"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Without a new program for early detection, screening, and treatment, 14,000 children and adults who suffer from HHT in the population today will suffer premature death and disability.</text>
