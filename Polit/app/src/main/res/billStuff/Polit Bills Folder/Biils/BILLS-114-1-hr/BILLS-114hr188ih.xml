			<paragraph id="H857966D786D94553915A923137410E19"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Current Federal law allows the Secretary of Labor to grant special wage certificates to entities
			 that provide employment to workers with disabilities, allowing such
			 entities to pay their disabled workers at rates that are lower than the
			 Federal minimum wage.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H21DDA1EBB53B41F19E542DD6050162B7"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The practice of paying workers with disabilities less than the Federal minimum wage dates back to
			 the 1930s, when there were virtually no employment opportunities for
			 disabled workers in the mainstream workforce.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5490258AF1984C8DB37651D18FBEEC72"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Today, advancements in vocational rehabilitation, technology, and training provide disabled workers
			 with greater opportunities than in the past, and the number of such
			 workers in the national workforce has dramatically increased.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HCE340BF1906844CE99C72B8E05760B36"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Employees with disabilities, when provided the proper rehabilitation services, training, and tools,
			 can be as productive as nondisabled employees. Even those individuals that
			 are considered most severely disabled have been able to successfully
			 obtain employment earning minimum wage or higher.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H69AFA9BBC0F544288367F17B42918AFE"><enum>(5)</enum><text>While some employers possessing special wage certificates claim to provide rehabilitation and
			 training to disabled workers to prepare them for competitive employment,
			 the fact that such employers can pay their workers less than the Federal
			 minimum wage gives them an incentive to exploit the cheap labor provided
			 by their disabled workers rather than to prepare those workers for
			 integrated employment in the mainstream economy.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H1734CC7DE5EE4F85B8123386C390204C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Many employers with a history of paying subminimum wages benefit from philanthropic donations and
			 preferred status when bidding on Federal contracts. Yet they claim that
			 paying minimum wage to their employees with disabilities would result in
			 lack of profitability and forced reduction of their workforces.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HE2DD10D9C21B433E9FDA0452118AA171"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Other employers, recognizing that the payment of subminimum wages is in fact exploitation of
			 disabled workers, are now paying the Federal minimum wage, or higher, to
			 their employees with disabilities without reducing their workforces, while
			 still maintaining their profitability. For example, National Industries
			 for the Blind (NIB) agencies exploited their blind employees for years
			 through the payment of subminimum wages, claiming they could not maintain
			 profitability otherwise. Now, <quote>All NIB associated agencies are committed to the NIB Board policy to pay employees, whose only
			 disability is blindness, at or above the Federal minimum wage or their
			 state minimum wage, whichever is highest.</quote>.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HCD9DAD4328144DF18B1C8547312F402B"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Wage and Hour Division of the Department of Labor is charged with the responsibility for
			 oversight of these special wage certificates. The results from thorough
			 investigations conducted by the Government Accountability Office—<quote>Stronger Federal Efforts Needed for Providing Employment Opportunities and Enforcing Labor
			 Standards in Sheltered Workshops, Report to the Congress, Comptroller
			 General of the United States</quote> (HRD–81–99) and <quote>Report to Congressional Requesters, Special Wage Program: Centers Offer Employment and Support
			 Services to Workers With Disabilities, But Labor Should Improve Oversight</quote> (GAO–01–886)—explain that due to lack of capacity, training, and resources, the Wage and Hour
			 Division is incapable of enforcing compliance with the subminimum wage
			 provision. Furthermore, the significant appropriation that would be
			 required to improve oversight of the regulation would be better spent
			 improving employment outcomes for people with disabilities.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H5856D886A1344E00A1E330D121B7B4F6"><enum>(9)</enum><text>According to the rules established under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938,
			 employers are to determine the special wage to be paid to a disabled
			 employee through a complicated method that unfairly establishes a
			 productivity benchmark that would be difficult for anyone to maintain. The
			 inability of many employers to correctly establish the wage pursuant to
			 the rule has regularly resulted in disabled employees receiving even less
			 than the special minimum wage (below the federally established minimum
			 wage) that they should have received under the regulation.</text>
