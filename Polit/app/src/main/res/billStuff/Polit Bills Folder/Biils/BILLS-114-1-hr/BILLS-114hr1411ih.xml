<paragraph id="HD4E286F9BD5A41D68CE8EFDF57C81F8E"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Seven out of 10 deaths among Americans each year are from chronic diseases. Heart disease, cancer, and stroke—each of which has been strongly linked to dietary and lifestyle choices—account for more than 50 percent of all deaths each year.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HBD3D8E756C1745138F9AE15A0160552B"><enum>(6)</enum><text>About 81.1 million people in the United States have at least one form of cardiovascular disease.

The American Heart Association estimates that, by 2030, direct costs related to cardiovascular disease will triple to around $818 billion. Research has shown that following a healthful diet can not only reduce symptoms related to heart disease but also reverse the damage done to the arteries.</text></paragraph>
