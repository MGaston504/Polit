Specialist Four Kinnard distinguished himself while attached as a medic on a combat operation near Quang Tri, Republic of Vietnam. The point platoon made contact with enemy positions in a hedgerow and two of the point men were seriously wounded. Without hesitation, Specialist Kinnard rushed through the heavy volume of enemy fire to reach the wounded men. With complete disregard for his own personal safety, Specialist Kinnard remained exposed to enemy fire while he treated the wounded men. Once he administered first aid to the wounded, Specialist Kinnard organized their evacuation under fire. His personal bravery and devotion to duty were in keeping with the highest traditions of the military service and reflect great credit upon himself, his unit, and United States Army.</quote>.</text>
