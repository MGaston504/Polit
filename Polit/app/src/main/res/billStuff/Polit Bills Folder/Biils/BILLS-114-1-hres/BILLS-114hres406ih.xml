	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas the United States House of Representatives brought widespread awareness to the plight of people with albinism in East Africa, where many shamans promote the deplorable belief that people with albinism are less than human, and use their body parts as charms in occult rituals, by passing H. Res. 1088 on March 10, 2010;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas widespread awareness and public outcry in recent years has led to improvements in the lives of people living with albinism in East Africa;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas challenges still exist, and our continued support of people with albinism in East Africa is needed;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United Nations Human Rights Council passed resolution 23/13 on June 13, 2013, calling for an end to attacks and discrimination against people with albinism and further urged <quote>States to adopt specific measures to protect and preserve the rights to life and security of persons with albinism</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas United Nations reports indicate that many albinos in Tanzania have been murdered since 2000 and their dismembered body parts have been sold for hundreds to thousands of dollars to be used as charms in rituals, many persons with albinism have been attacked resulting in dismemberment, and grave robbers have exhumed graves seeking limbs and bodies of persons with albinism to sell;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas many people with albinism still lack access to medical services especially for skin cancer and vision problems from which they suffer at higher rates than people without albinism; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas many people with albinism in East Africa remain highly marginalized and consequently have little access to education, skills training, jobs, and entrepreneurship opportunities: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
