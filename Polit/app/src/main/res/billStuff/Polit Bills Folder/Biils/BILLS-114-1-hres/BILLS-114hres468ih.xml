	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas hydrogen, which has an atomic mass of 1.008, is the most abundant chemical substance in the universe;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States is a world leader in the development and deployment of fuel cell and hydrogen technologies;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas hydrogen fuel cells played an instrumental role in the United States space program, helping the United States achieve the mission of landing a man on the moon;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private industry, Federal and State governments, national laboratories, and universities continue to improve fuel cell and hydrogen technologies to address our most pressing energy, environmental, and economic issues;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas fuel cells utilizing hydrogen and hydrogen-rich fuels to generate electricity are clean, efficient, resilient technologies being sold for stationary and backup power, zero-emission light duty motor vehicles and buses, industrial vehicles, and portable power;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas stationary fuel cells are being placed in service for continuous and backup power to provide business and energy consumers with reliable power in the event of grid outages;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas stationary fuel cells can help reduce water use compared to traditional power generation technologies;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas fuel cell electric light duty motor vehicles and buses that utilize hydrogen can completely replicate the experience of internal combustion vehicles including comparable range and refueling times;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas hydrogen fuel cell industrial vehicles are being deployed at logistical hubs and warehouses across the country and are also being exported to facilities in Europe and Asia;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas hydrogen is a non-toxic gas that can be derived from a variety of domestically available traditional and renewable resources, including solar, wind, biogas and the abundant supply of natural gas in the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas hydrogen and fuel cells can store energy to help enhance the grid and maximize opportunities to deploy renewable energy;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States currently produces and uses more than 11,000,000 metric tons of hydrogen per year;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas engineers and safety code and standard professionals have developed consensus-based protocols for safe delivery, handling, and use of hydrogen; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, October 8, 2015, would be an appropriate date to designate as <quote>National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day</quote>: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble> <resolution-body id="H23C04294F4B54193A937EE1B171CAA0C" style="traditional"> <section display-inline="yes-display-inline" id="H3CE36FACF2C24285B7EAA55766900E38" section-type="undesignated-section"><enum></enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">That the House of Representatives supports the designation of “National Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Day”.</text>
