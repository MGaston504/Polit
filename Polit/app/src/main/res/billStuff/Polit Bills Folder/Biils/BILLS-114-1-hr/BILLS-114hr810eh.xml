This research provides the basis for the technology development that enables the Administration’s many challenging missions to succeed. If current trends continue, the Administration’s ability to attract and maintain the best and brightest engineering workforce at its Centers as well as its ability to remain on the cutting edge of aeronautical and space technology will continue to erode and will threaten the Administration’s ability to be a world leader in aeronautics research and development and space exploration.</text> </subsection> <subsection id="H60AC89A24F2F4302956A39627461F6F3"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Plan</header><text>The Administrator shall develop a plan for restoring a meaningful basic engineering research program at the Administration’s Centers, including, as appropriate, collaborations with industry, universities, and other relevant organizations.
