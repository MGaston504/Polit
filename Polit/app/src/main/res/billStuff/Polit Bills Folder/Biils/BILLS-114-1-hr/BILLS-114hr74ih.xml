			<paragraph id="HF676D9C644674476A6E40E0273BCC344"><enum>(1)</enum><text>According to the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, research has
			 demonstrated that video recording of custodial interrogations furthers
			 three important civic values: truth-finding, efficient and fair
			 administration of justice, and protection of constitutional guarantees.
			 See Richard A. Leo, Police Interrogation and American Justice 296–305

			</paragraph><paragraph id="HD1BE197E99FE4D59B0F07FFFEAB5D2C4"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Video recording of the entire process of custodial interrogation has proven to be a major advance
			 in law enforcement, improving the ability to solve crimes and prove cases
			 while lowering the overall costs of investigation and litigation.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H817F5AFB9E744F5F8B137BAD1ADAF2F2"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Video recording of custodial interrogations promotes truth-finding in several ways, including by
			 reducing the incentive to fabricate, compensating for faulty or unreliable
			 recollections of witnesses, deterring problematic interrogation methods,
			 filtering out weak cases, and enhancing the ability of finders of fact to
			 assess witness credibility and veracity.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H2964D41D4B8241EA829C68F851472806"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Video recording of custodial interrogations promotes efficiency in the administration of the
			 criminal justice system by reducing the number of frivolous suppression
			 motions, improving the quality of police investigations, improving the
			 quality of review and case screening by prosecutors, and reducing the
			 likelihood of hung juries.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HAADC8B9593B544129080E6E511FF0769"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Video recording of custodial interrogations safeguards constitutional rights and values by making
			 it easier for courts to adjudicate motions to suppress, by making it
			 easier for prosecutors to preserve and disclose material exculpatory
			 evidence required under the Supreme Court decision in Brady v. Maryland,
			 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by making it easier for superiors to train police
			 officers in how to comply with constitutional mandates and for the press,
			 and by making it easier for the press, the judiciary, prosecutors,
			 independent watchdog groups, and police administrators to identify and
			 correct misuses of power by law enforcement.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H57393B70D18048DDB16A81EB344A095C"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Video recordings of custodial interrogations make it easier to identify and avoid biases, which
			 would otherwise be difficult to detect and correct because such biases are
			 often unconscious, thus operating outside police awareness.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="H096A57A97F9D4A5E9EBC27AD94B5B5F6"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Video recordings of custodial interrogations help to improve public confidence in the fairness and
			 professionalism of policing, which in a democracy not only is a good in
			 itself but also a proven means of reducing crime and enhancing citizen
			 cooperation in solving crimes.</text>
			</paragraph><paragraph id="HA9D32EC3435F42C391702E37E4CE6F41"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Video recording of the entire process of custodial interrogation is likely to be a major boon to
			 law enforcement, improving its ability to prove its cases while lowering
			 overall costs of investigation and litigation. Such recording will also,
			 however, improve systemic accuracy, fairness to the accused and the State
			 alike, protection of constitutional rights, and public confidence in the
			 justice system.</text>
