It is clear that the acquisition reform efforts of the last 50 years continue to founder because they fail to address the motivational and environmental factors in which they must be implemented. The acquisition system, though frustrating to all, is in one sense in equilibrium. The acquisition system provides enough benefits to proponents and opponents to continue, with only minor changes, despite its shortcomings.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCCAF7C37238E4AD190A8FDAD7490BFA8"><enum>(3)</enum><text>To keep programs alive, the Department develops and Congress accepts fragile acquisition strategies that downplay technical issues and assume only successful outcomes from high-risk efforts. As a result, the Department often ends up with too few weapons, with performance that falls short, that are difficult and costly to maintain, delivered late at too high a cost. Congressional and Department of Defense leadership have limited insight into the services acquired or what services need to be acquired in the future. Furthermore, the conventional acquisition process is not agile enough for today’s demands. Finally, the Department of Defense continues to struggle with financial management and auditability, affecting its ability to control costs, ensure basic accountability, anticipate future costs and claims on the budget, and measure performance.</text>

This situation is unacceptable. For example, according to the Final Report of the 2010 Army Acquisition Review, between 1996 and 2010, the Army expended approximately $1 billion to $3 billion annually on two dozen programs that were eventually cancelled. No military service and no type of weapon acquisition has been immune.</text>

Industry and Government officials frequently respond by taking additional development risks to resolve basic performance issues by reducing the time to analyze and assess development results, overlapping key development efforts, and reducing testing. The Department of Defense and Congress disrupt the planned funding of stable programs to find resources for troubled programs or to fund across-the-board spending cuts. Funding instability is the inevitable price that programs pay for survival because funding disruptions actually keep more programs alive.</text>
