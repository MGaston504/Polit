 <paragraph id="H45BDADE9EE714AC3A7868F6BF2327DAA"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Beginning in 1975, Congress required Social Security retirement benefits to automatically increase annually in order to provide a cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), based on increases in the Consumer Price Index for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, or CPI–W, a data set issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H463471EF2A6241EAA24A198C26A2DDBD"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Social Security Administration website correctly explains that the purpose of the COLA is <quote>to ensure that the purchasing power of Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits is not eroded by inflation</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDCBFF0B046C7487EAAC751FA420C4688"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The CPI–W data set published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics has come under criticism, as the BLS has made repeated changes in the methodology for calculation, particularly since 1980, so that it no longer measures maintaining a constant standard of living by reflecting changes in price of a fixed market basket of goods and services, but rather reflects the consumer substitution of less-expensive products and services as prices rise.</text>
