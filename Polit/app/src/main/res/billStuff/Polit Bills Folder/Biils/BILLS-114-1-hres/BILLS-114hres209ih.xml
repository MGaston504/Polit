 <whereas><text>Whereas the House of Representatives supports the long-standing position of the United States Government to insist on the resolution of the Israel-Palestinian conflict through direct negotiations between the two parties;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the House of Representatives has long appropriated United States taxpayer funds to facilitate a negotiated solution between the two parties;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the House of Representatives believes the current policy of the Palestinian Authority to seek legitimacy for unilateral statehood through international institutions is toxic to the prospects of a negotiated solution with Israel;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the use of lawfare is a national security danger to all democracies, including the United States and its democratic allies, who engage their militaries to defend their sovereignty and fight against and defeat terrorism, the House of Representatives views the current policy of the Palestinian Authority to use lawfare against Israel as a dangerous precedent that threatens the national security of the United States and its democratic allies; and</text>
