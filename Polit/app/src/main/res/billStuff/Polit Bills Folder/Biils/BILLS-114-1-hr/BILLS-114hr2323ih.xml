 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD5B338E9649E4E65A10510A3F808620A"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that <quote>[e]veryone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression</quote>, and that <quote>this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5FAB9040773E46D8AC6CB09BEBE944DA"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Secretary of State Hillary Clinton testified before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives on January 23, 2013, that the Broadcasting Board of Governors (BBG) <quote>is practically a defunct agency in terms of its capacity to be able to tell a message around the world. So we’re abdicating the ideological arena and need to get back into it.</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H324DC3707A174466B62C1CD00AAAEFC9"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The BBG, which was created by Congress to oversee the United States international broadcasting in the wake of the Cold War, has, because of structural and managerial issues, had limited success to date in both coordinating the various components of the international broadcasting framework and managing the day-to-day operations of the Federal components of the international broadcasting framework.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2C211147063F4126B929EE9399489796"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The lack of regular attendance by board members and a periodic inability to form a quorum have plagued the BBG and, as a result, it has been functionally incapable of running the agency.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H15921F0C0904433094FBFA4A60A41C41"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The board of governors has only achieved the full slate of all nine governors for seven of its 17 years of existence, which highlights the difficulties of confirming and retaining governors under the current structure.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H55837E2DABC44DD597008199DFBDF0A7"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Both the Department of State’s Office of Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office have issued reports which outline a severely dysfunctional organizational structure of the Broadcasting Board of Governors.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H032993F259BD40679FB28E57DB737B32"><enum>(8)</enum><text>The Inspector General of the Department of State concluded in its January 2013 report that dysfunction of the BBG stems from <quote>a flawed legislative structure and acute internal dissension</quote>.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3581BBC460C54D61A1756471397CB514"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Inspector General of the Department of State also found that the BBG’s structure of nine part-time members <quote>cannot effectively supervise all United States Government-supported, civilian international broadcasting</quote>, and its involvement in day-to-day operations has impeded normal management functions.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDCE59739DCAD40E5B96B6BBDE9F74501"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The Government Accountability Office report determined that there was significant overlap among the BBG’s languages services, and that the BBG did not systematically consider the financial cost of overlap.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA740FD98340A4DBFA0529CB1B540ADBA"><enum>(11)</enum><text>According to the Office of the Inspector General, the BBG’s Office of Contracts is not in compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation, lacks appropriate contract oversight, and violates the Anti-Deficiency Act. The Office of the Inspector General also determined that the Broadcasting Board of Governors has not adequately performed full and open competitions or price determinations, has entered into hundreds of personal service contracts without statutory authority, and contractors regularly work without valid contracts in place.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3278F609087846D09AAE13754EDBA14E"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The size and make-up of the BBG workforce should be closely examined, given the agency’s broader broadcasting and technical mission, as well as changing media technologies.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H910129315A5A4B49B62ACA3269E34BFF"><enum>(13)</enum><text>The BBG should be structured to ensure that more taxpayer dollars are dedicated to the substantive, broadcasting, and information-related elements of the agency’s mission.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H3620F526DC624874AA9D4F3479E37C90"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The lack of a coherent and well defined mission of the Voice of America has led to programming that duplicates the efforts of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting, Radio Free Asia, RFE/RL, Incorporated, and the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Incorporated that results in inefficient use of tax-payer funding.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H07628C0F82314E65A06BF257FE4D7299"><enum>(15)</enum><text>The annual survey conducted by the <quote>Partnership for Public Service</quote> consistently ranks the Broadcasting Board of Governors at or near the bottom of all Federal agencies in terms of <quote>overall best places to work</quote> and <quote>the extent to which employees feel their skills and talents are used effectively</quote>. The consistency of these low scores point to structural, cultural, and functional problems at the Broadcasting Board of Governors.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H62A6207F92794952A8CE1F289674BE76"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The Federal and non-Federal organizations that comprise the United States international broadcasting framework have different, yet complementary, missions that necessitate coordination at all levels of management.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8072394069B947699A6BEE92764C70F3"><enum>(17)</enum><text>The Broadcasting Board of Governors has an overabundance of senior civil service positions, defined here as full-time employees encumbering GS–14 and GS–15 positions on the General Schedule pay scale.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEB4D6CB615A845738F1B9B51E0F186D5"><enum>(18)</enum><text>United States international broadcasting should seek to leverage public-private partnerships, including the licensing of content and the use of technology owned or operated by non-governmental sources, where possible to expand outreach capacity.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5F67EF84831146E79C2A72CD22759DDE"><enum>(19)</enum><text>Shortwave broadcasting has been an important method of communication that should be utilized in regions as a component of United States international broadcasting where a critical need for the platform exists.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H84EBE914A3E84BB8B0A6750370EE68C8"><enum>(20)</enum><text>Congressional action is necessary at this time to improve international broadcasting operations, strengthen the United States public diplomacy efforts, enhance the grantee surrogate broadcasting effort, restore focus to news, programming, and content, and maximize the value of Federal and non-Federal resources that are dedicated to public diplomacy and international broadcasting.</text>
