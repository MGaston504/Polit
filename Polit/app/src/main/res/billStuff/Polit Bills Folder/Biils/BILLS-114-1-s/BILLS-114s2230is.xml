While al-Banna's plan for accomplishing this mission was multifaceted, it centrally incorporated training for and the execution of violent jihad–terrorist operations.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id4c4f71c46421430e8797f743f0871af9"><enum>(12)</enum><text>In Richard P. Mitchell’s 1969 book on the history of the Muslim Brotherhood, entitled <quote>The Society of Muslim Brothers</quote>, Professor Mitchell explained al-Banna's teachings on violent jihad: The certainty that jihad had this physical connotation is evidenced by the relationship always implied between it and the possibility, even the necessity, of death and martyrdom. Death, as an important end of jihad, was extolled by al-Banna in a phrase which came to be a famous part of his legacy: <quote>[T]he art of death</quote>. <quote>Death is art</quote>. The Koran has commanded people to love death more than life. Unless <quote>the philosophy of the Koran on death</quote> replaces <quote>the love of life</quote> which has consumed Muslims, then they will reach naught. Victory can only come with the mastery of <quote>the art of death</quote>. The movement cannot succeed, al-Banna insists, without this dedicated and unqualified kind of jihad.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id7b48433c08784cee9dd79e5068734f0a"><enum>(13)</enum><text>This philosophy pervaded the Muslim Brotherhood’s prioritization of training for combat. Professor Mitchell observed that it was <quote>the tone of the training which gave [the Muslim Brotherhood] its distinctive qualities</quote>, adding: <quote>If the Muslim Brothers were more effectively violent than other groups on the Egyptian scene, it was because militancy and martyrdom had been elevated to central virtues in the Society's ethos.</quote>. Its literature and speeches were permeated with references identifying it and its purposes in military terms. Al-Banna told members again and again that they were <quote>the army of liberation, carrying on your shoulders the message of liberation; you are the battalions of salvation for this nation afflicted by calamity</quote>.</text>

The conferences included representatives from Iranian intelligence, Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and the Armed Islamic Group of Algeria, and leaders from the international Muslim Brotherhood, the Muslim Brotherhood in the Gulf Countries, Hamas (the Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood), the Islamic Action Front (Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood), and the Ennahda Movement (the Tunisian Muslim Brotherhood). Osama bin Laden was present at the conferences. The parties agreed to launch a terrorism offensive beginning in 1995, with targets including United States interests and personnel in the Middle East and attacks inside the United States homeland.</text>

Clinton and George W. Bush, testified before the <committee-name committee-id="SSBK00">Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate</committee-name> that terrorist organizations continued to operate inside the United States and their connection to the Muslim Brotherhood networks, stating <quote>Dating back to the 1980's, Islamist terrorist networks have developed a sophisticated and diversified financial infrastructure in the United States. In the post September 11th environment, it is now widely known that every major Islamist terrorist organization, from Hamas to Islamic Jihad to al-Qaeda, has leveraged the financial resources and institutions of the United States to build their capabilities. We face a highly developed enemy in our mission to stop terrorist financing. While the overseas operations of Islamist terrorist organizations are generally segregated and distinct, the opposite holds in the United States. The issue of terrorist financing in the United States is a fundamental example of the shared infrastructure levered by Hamas, Islamic Jihad and al-Qaeda, all of which enjoy a significant degree of cooperation and coordination within our borders. The common link here is the extremist Muslim Brotherhood—all of these organizations are descendants of the membership and ideology of the Muslim Brothers.</quote>.</text>

According to Federal prosecutors, the shareholders of Baitul Mal included al-Qaeda financier Yassin al-Qadi and top Hamas leader Mousa abu Marzook, both of whom are specially designated global terrorists and operated separate businesses out of the offices of Baitul Mal, Incorporated and also did business with Baitul Mal, Incorporated. Other Baitul Mal, Incorporated investors included Abdullah bin Laden, nephew of Osama bin Laden, and Tarek Swaidan, a Kuwaiti Muslim Brotherhood leader. In a September 2003 detention hearing, Federal prosecutors described Biheiri as <quote>the United States banker for the Muslim Brotherhood,</quote> and stating that <quote>the defendant came here as the Muslim Brotherhood's financial toehold in the United States.</quote>. Biheiri was convicted on Federal immigration charges on October 9, 2003.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="idaa9cb0bb946c4d13aeb3ad916be76764"><enum>(27)</enum><text>In the Holy Land Foundation prosecutions—the largest terrorism financing trial in United States history—Department of Justice officials successfully argued in court that the international Muslim Brotherhood and its United States affiliates had engaged in a widespread conspiracy to raise money and materially support the terrorist group Hamas. HLF officials charged in the case were found guilty on all counts in November 2008, primarily related to millions of dollars that had been transferred to Hamas. During the trial and in court documents, Federal prosecutors implicated a number of prominent United States-Islamic organizations in this conspiracy, including the Islamic Society of North America, the North American Islamic Trust, and the Council on American-Islamic Relations. These groups and their leaders, among others, were named as unindicted co-conspirators in the case. The Department of Justice told the court that these United States-Muslim Brotherhood affiliates acted at the direction of the international Muslim Brotherhood to support terrorism in a July 2008 court filing: <quote>ISNA and NAIT, in fact, shared more with HLF than just a parent organization. They were intimately connected with the Holy Land Foundation and its assigned task of providing financial support to HAMAS. Shortly after HAMAS was founded in 1987, as an outgrowth of the Muslim Brotherhood, the International Muslim Brotherhood ordered the Muslim Brotherhood chapters throughout the world to create Palestine Committees, who supported HAMAS with <quote>media, money and men</quote>. The U.S.-Muslim Brotherhood created the United States Palestine Committee, which documents reflect was initially comprised of 3 organizations: the Holy Land Foundation, the Islamic Association for Palestine, and the United Association for Studies and Research. CAIR was later added to these organizations. The mandate of these organizations, per the International Muslim Brotherhood, was to support HAMAS, and the HLF's particular role was to raise money to support HAMAS' organizations inside the Palestinian territories.</quote>.</text>

Calling on Arab and Muslim regimes to confront not just Israel, but also the United States, he declared that <quote>Resistance is the only solution against the Zio-American arrogance and tyranny.</quote>. This <quote>resistance</quote> can only come from fighting and understanding <quote>that the improvement and change that the [Muslim] nation seeks can only be attained through jihad and sacrifice and by raising a jihadi generation that pursues death just as the enemies pursue life</quote>.

Attacks included 70 churches and more than 1,000 homes and businesses of Coptic Christian families torched in the ensuing violence. During the Muslim Brotherhood protests, there were repeated reports of direct incitement towards the Copts from leading Muslim Brotherhood figures, and since the protest dispersal this targeting of the Christian community continues in official statements on Muslim Brotherhood social media outlets and from its leadership. As the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has previously noted, this terror campaign by the Muslim Brotherhood is not a new development. Over the past decade violence by the Muslim Brotherhood has been directed at the Coptic community. As the USCIRF observed in its 2003 Annual Report: <quote>Coptic Christians face ongoing violence from vigilante Muslim extremists, including members of the Muslim Brotherhood, many of whom act with impunity.</quote>.</text>
