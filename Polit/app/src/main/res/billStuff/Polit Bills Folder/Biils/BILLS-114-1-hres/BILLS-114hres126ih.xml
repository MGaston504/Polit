 <whereas><text>Whereas United States support for a two-state solution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict is based on the recognition that this solution can both best serve Israel’s security and permanence as a Jewish and democratic homeland while helping the Palestinian people achieve a future of independence and national self-determination;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a true and lasting two-state solution is essential to the resolution of Israeli–Arab disputes and to the achievement of long-term peace and stability in the broader Middle East;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a true and lasting two-state solution is in the national security interests of the United States and to ensure the safety and security of Israel;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a true and lasting two-state solution will only be established through resolution of outstanding issues between Israel and the recognized leadership of the Palestinian people;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas successive United States Presidents and successive United States Congresses have recognized that promoting Israeli–Palestinian and Israeli–Arab peace is an integral element of the United States commitment to Israel’s security and its survival, as well as to the stability of the entire Middle East region;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas successive United States administrations, led by Presidents from both parties, have invested substantial diplomatic resources in support of peace efforts, including under—</text>

Bush, the 2001 <quote>Sharm El-Sheikh Fact-Finding Committee Report</quote>, also known as the Mitchell Report, the 2003 <quote>Roadmap for Peace in the Middle East</quote>, the 2005 Agreement on Movement and Access, and the 2007 Annapolis Conference; and</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4510910835834F7B813854C00E4ADE8E"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">President Barack Obama, the 2009 appointment of Senator George Mitchell as the United States Special Envoy for Middle East peace, and the tireless efforts of Secretary of State John Kerry to pursue a lasting resolution to the conflict via negotiations with Israel and the Palestinians;</text>
 </paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Hamas does not recognize Israel’s right to exist, has repeatedly launched rocket and missile attacks against and built tunnels into Israel, has not disavowed violence, and does not recognize or abide by existing binding agreements;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the State of Israel is subject to existential threats from those seeking to deny the deep historical, cultural, and spiritual connection of the Jewish people to their homeland;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on March 21, 2013, while speaking in both Ramallah and Jerusalem, President Obama stated that the Palestinian people deserve <quote>an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it.</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas President Obama added, <quote>It is not right to prevent Palestinians from farming their lands; to restrict a student’s ability to move around the West Bank; or to displace Palestinian families from their home. Neither occupation nor expulsion is the answer. Just as Israelis built a state in their homeland, Palestinians have a right to be a free people in their own land.</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the loss of lives in Gaza and Israel during the summer of 2014 surrounding Israel’s Operation Protective Edge demonstrate that there is no military solution to this conflict and Hamas’ terror tactics will never lead to a Palestinian future of self-determination;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas successive United States administrations have opposed Israeli settlements in the occupied territories, recognizing them to be a political and security liability for Israel and an impediment to efforts to achieve a negotiated resolution to the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, among other reasons; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States goal of helping to secure Israel’s security and safety as a democratic homeland for the Jewish people well into the future is best served through achievement of an agreement between Israel and the Palestinians to resolve their conflict: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
