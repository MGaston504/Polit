 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, on August 31, 2008, Magomed Yevloyev, owner of a news site called Ingushetiya, popular for its human rights and press freedom stories, died from a gunshot wound to the head sustained while being transported by regional Ingushetia police following his arrest at the airport in the regional capital;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas impunity and lack of accountability prevail in the Russian Federation;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas law enforcement, judicial, and investigative bodies are often used to target political opponents and civil society in the Russian Federation and thus lack the credibility to conduct an investigation themselves; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Russian Federation is a member of both the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe and the Council of Europe, and these independent groups should be considered for investigation into Mr. Nemtsov’s murder in order to lend the investigation credibility: Now, therefore, be it</text>
