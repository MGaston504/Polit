 <whereas><text>Whereas summer is the season with the highest rates of gun violence in the United States;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 100,000 Americans suffer gunshot wounds in the United States every year;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas approximately 89 people die and approximately 300 are injured from gun violence each day in the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas more than 50 percent of all gunshot victims in the United States are under 30 years old;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas every 60 minutes one American under the age of 25 loses his or her life to gun violence;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 5 percent of gun dealers (approximately 3,000 dealers nationwide) supply nearly 90 percent of all crime guns that show up in American streets;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas fewer than 100 people in the United States have been killed in terror attacks since September 11, 2001, but tens of thousands have been killed by gun violence in that same time period;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas more Americans have died from gunshot wounds in the past three decades than the sum total of combat deaths in all the wars in United States history;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas two-thirds of all homicides and half of all suicides are a result of gunshot wounds;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 90 percent of homicides of law enforcement officers are a result of gunshot wounds;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 20 percent of female homicide victims are killed by a current or former partner using firearms;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas gun violence declined in the 1990s after the enactment of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1993, which created a national background check system, and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which placed a ten-year ban on the sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas with the rise over time of sales in <quote>no questions asked</quote> transactions, 40 percent of guns sold in America are now done so without a Brady background check;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the ban on the sale of assault weapons and large capacity ammunition magazines expired in 2004;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas murder due to gunshot wounds climbed 25 percent in Missouri when universal background checks were lifted;</text>
