The absence of paid sick time has forced Americans to make untenable choices between needed income and jobs on the one hand and caring for their own and their family’s health on the other. It is in the national interest to ensure that all Americans can care for their own health and the health of their families while prospering at work.</text>

Another 4,000,000 theoretically have access to sick time, but have not been on the job long enough to use it.

Studies in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, the Employee Benefit News, and the Harvard Business Review show that presenteeism is a larger productivity drain than either absenteeism or short-term disability.</text>

Domestic violence also affects men. Women account for about 85 percent of the victims of domestic violence and men account for approximately 15 percent of the victims. Therefore, women disproportionately need time off to care for their health or to find solutions, such as obtaining a restraining order or finding housing, to avoid or prevent physical or sexual abuse.</text>

The loss of employment can be particularly devastating for victims of domestic violence, who often need economic security to ensure safety.</text>
