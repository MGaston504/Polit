 <paragraph id="idbe91a814ee5940cda9404c2ac12e653c"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The abuse of heroin and prescription painkillers is having a devastating effect on public health and safety in communities across the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths now surpass traffic crashes in the number of deaths caused by injury in the United States. In 2011, an average of about 110 people in the United States died from drug overdose every day.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id5c5acce950ec4de39d5f97ec750138a2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Law enforcement officials and treatment experts throughout the country report that many prescription opioid users have turned to heroin as a cheaper or more easily obtained alternative to prescription drugs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id030a152878ed4fc8ab9a0c81bf760b46"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Opioid pain relievers are the most widely misused or abused controlled prescription drugs (commonly referred to as <quote>CPDs</quote>) and are involved in most CPD-related overdose incidents. According to the Drug Abuse Warning Network (commonly known as <quote>DAWN</quote>), the estimated number of emergency department visits involving nonmedical use of prescription opiates or opioids increased by 112 percent between 2006 and 2010, from 84,671 to 179,787.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idc1ea0f811f4d484ab6f8c7bd0d5e1ae6"><enum>(4)</enum><text>According to a report by the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors (commonly referred to as <quote>NASADAD</quote>), 37 States reported an increase in admissions to treatment for heroin use during the past 2 years, while admissions to treatment for prescription opiates increased 500 percent from 2000 to 2012.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id46f5ffd3f34446fca6e68d2ca803bfef"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Substance use disorders are a treatable disease. Discoveries in the science of addiction have led to advances in the treatment of substance use disorders that help people stop abusing drugs and prescription medications and resume their productive lives.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idb36826f9e68a498fad68c503aaa62906"><enum>(6)</enum><text>According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, approximately 22,700,000 people in the United States needed substance use disorder treatment in 2013, but only 2,500,000 people received it. Furthermore, current treatment services are not adequate to meet demand. According to a report commissioned by SAMHSA, there are approximately 32 providers for every 1,000 individuals needing substance use disorder treatment. In some States, the ratio is much lower.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id348731b39f1249019c878e747ba3e4c6"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Effective substance abuse prevention can yield major economic dividends.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="id395ed0e540434555a8f02abca92b8569"><enum>(8)</enum><text>According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, when schools and communities properly implement science-validated substance abuse prevention programs, abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs is reduced. Such programs help teachers, parents, and healthcare professionals shape the perceptions of youths about the risks of drug abuse.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id2cdf1419c68d49f0b0f8a77ddc2f30ca"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Diverting individuals with substance use disorders from criminal justice systems into community-based treatment can save billions of dollars and prevent sizeable numbers of crimes, arrests, and re-incarcerations over the course of those individuals’ lives.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id34c2e1e06e74481ca718b0bacc310a91"><enum>(10)</enum><text>According to the Drug Enforcement Agency, more than 1,700 tons of expired, unwanted prescription medications have been collected during the past 3<fraction>1/2</fraction> years, following the enactment of the Secure and Responsible Drug Disposal Act of 2010 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/273">Public Law 111–273</external-xref>; 124 Stat. 2858).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ida3c354aecd884bffa33f48183a021f11"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Research shows that combining treatment medications with behavioral therapy is the best way to facilitate success for most patients. Treatment approaches must be tailored to address the drug abuse patterns and drug-related medical, psychiatric, and social problems of each individual. Different types of medications may be useful at different stages of treatment or recovery to help a patient stop using drugs, stay in treatment, and avoid relapse.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idf7c16c089e604dffaef2d9fe77130f43"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Research indicates that combating the opioid crisis, including abuse of prescription painkillers and, increasingly, heroin, requires a multi-pronged approach that involves reducing drug diversion, expanding delivery of existing treatments (including medication assisted treatments), expanding access to overdose medications and interventions, and the development of new medications for pain that can augment the existing treatment arsenal.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ida1479e18c8f24323b7cd78013b983819"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Individuals with mental illness, especially severe mental illness, are at considerably higher risk for substance abuse than the general population, and the presence of a mental illness complicates recovery from substance abuse.</text>
