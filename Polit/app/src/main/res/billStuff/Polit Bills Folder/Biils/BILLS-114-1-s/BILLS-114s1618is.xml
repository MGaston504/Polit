 <paragraph id="iddc967ba4b5964af48c0975e4205acbbc"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The United States is the global leader in wireless communications and broadband technologies, both of which are vital parts of daily life in the United States, key components of the national infrastructure of the United States, and a significant driver of the United States economy.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id6bcae72648294236a7c9325be7457a9c"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Wireless communications and broadband services have become critical for individuals to improve their economic well-being, businesses to compete in the 21st century, first responders to protect individuals in emergencies, and Federal agencies to service their missions, such as national defense.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id896bceaff8944d0da463ff6b98f0bf53"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Because of the proliferation of broadband connected wireless devices and consumer applications, the volume of data traffic traveling over wireless networks has been growing substantially, and with the pace of innovation accelerating, the demand for wireless data services will continue to increase exponentially.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idf53f291d2d2240eda86e3a79b12ef5bc"><enum>(4)</enum><text>The Council of Economic Advisors has concluded that the only feasible way to realize the full potential of wireless broadband is to make new spectrum available for wireless services, and considerable spectrum is underused or used in less economically valuable ways, and could be repurposed and reallocated for wireless broadband use.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id8d3d180e23de40179cdb05930de49a06"><enum>(5)</enum><text>If the United States does not make more spectrum available, scarcity of spectrum could lead to higher prices for wireless services, poor service quality, the inability of the United States to compete internationally, constrained mobile broadband growth, and ultimately, a drag on innovation and individual economic mobility.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id2b740f24f1f943d5af148f95b2f3af70"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The National Broadband Plan, created by the Federal Communications Commission, set a goal of making 500 megahertz of spectrum newly available for commercial mobile broadband use by 2020, including making 300 megahertz between 225 megahertz and 3.7 gigahertz newly available for mobile use within 5 years, and stated that reallocating this spectrum where possible for mobile broadband use should be a priority.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id2dea1913f85546f4bd759bfe27e56bdb"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Reallocating and auctioning spectrum produces multiple benefits. A Federal licensee can upgrade to comparable or superior communications technology, an auction raises money for the United States Treasury, and taxpayers benefit from increased access to, and better use of, spectrum.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id07f2e4b0b8974e598d8a968874ab7dde"><enum>(8)</enum><text>In addition to reallocating spectrum, the United States should pursue a comprehensive approach to spectrum policy that includes expanding the capacity of wireless networks, promoting secondary spectrum markets, expanding unlicensed networks and Wi-Fi systems, and increasing efficiency and transparency among Federal users.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idbf4feb05c36f4d568beee77c355abe79"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The Federal Government, as the largest user of spectrum, must also promote the efficient use of spectrum resources, and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration must ensure that Federal agencies use this valuable public resource in the most efficient and effective manner possible.</text>
