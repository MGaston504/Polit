 <whereas><text>Whereas the Border Patrol’s Yuma Sector has long grappled with the crossing of undocumented aliens and has seen illegal traffic decline precipitously from the early 2000s to the present;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a combination of increased manpower, technology implementation, and the delivery of appropriate consequences have resulted in gains in border security in the Yuma Sector;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a key to the success in the Yuma Sector has been the implementation of Operation Streamline, a program established in 2005 that was described by former Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano as <quote>a DHS partnership with the Department of Justice, … a geographically focused operation that aims to increase the consequences for illegally crossing the border by criminally prosecuting illegal border-crossers.</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas known for its <quote>zero-tolerance</quote> approach, the Yuma County Sheriff’s Office cites 100 percent prosecution of illegal border crossers as a shared goal of a partnership including Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas among the various consequences delivered to illegal crossers by the Department of Homeland Security, Operation Streamline is associated with a recidivism rate that is well below average and has seen a steady decrease in recidivism in recent years;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Arizona will reportedly no longer be prosecuting those apprehended crossing the border illegally for the first time; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the Sheriff of Yuma County, Operation Streamline <quote>had a deterrent effect in Yuma County, which gained a reputation as an area to avoid crossing into because if caught, you were assured to go to court and possibly face penalties</quote>, but now the program <quote>has been severely diluted.</quote>: Now, therefore, be it</text>
