 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on September 24, 2014, the President highlighted the United States’ support for the advancement of women, noting: <quote>Where women are full participants in a country’s politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed. And that’s why we support the participation of women in parliaments and peace processes, schools, and the economy.</quote>;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women remain underrepresented in conflict prevention and conflict resolution efforts, despite proven success by women in conflict-affected regions in moderating violent extremism, countering terrorism, resolving disputes through nonviolent mediation and negotiation, and stabilizing societies by improving access to peace and security services, institutions, and decisionmaking venues;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas on December 19, 2011, the Obama Administration launched the first United States National Action Plan on Women, Peace, and Security (referred to in this preamble as the <quote>National Action Plan</quote>) that includes a comprehensive set of national commitments to advance the active participation of women in decisionmaking relating to matters of war and peace;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the National Action Plan states the following: <quote>Deadly conflicts can be more effectively avoided, and peace can be best forged and sustained, when women become equal partners in all aspects of peace-building and conflict prevention, when their lives are protected, their experiences considered, and their voices heard.</quote>;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the United Nations, women have access to fewer income-earning opportunities and are more likely to manage the household and engage in agricultural work, making women more vulnerable to economic insecurity caused by natural disasters and long-term changes in weather patterns;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the World Bank, women own or partly own more than <fraction>1/3</fraction> of small and medium-sized enterprises in developing countries, and 40 percent of the global workforce is female, yet women entrepreneurs and employers have disproportionately less access to capital and other financial services compared to men;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas despite strides in recent decades, women around the world continue to face significant obstacles in all aspects of their lives, including underrepresentation in all aspects of public life, denial of basic human rights, and discrimination;</text>
