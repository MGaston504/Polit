 <paragraph commented="no" id="H3A5557361E894C64902C4CEFCA044D4E"><enum>(1)</enum><text>From 1961 to 1971, approximately 19,000,000 gallons of 15 different herbicides were sprayed over the southern region of Vietnam. The agents included 13,000,000 gallons of Agent Orange, 4,500,000 gallons of Agent White, 1,000,000 gallons of Agent Blue, 420,000 gallons of Agent Purple, and relatively smaller quantities of the other herbicides. Many of the herbicides, including Agents Orange, Purple, Green, Pink, Dinoxol, and Trinoxol contained the toxic contaminant dioxin (TCDD). One, Agent Blue, contained high levels of arsenic. The aforementioned 15 herbicides, including the contaminant dioxin, are usually collectively referred to as Agent Orange.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDE9FEEE7A2794A2EBFA33B80B22BC9BF"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Studies show that between 2,100,000 and 4,800,000 Vietnamese and tens of thousands of Americans were exposed to Agent Orange during the spraying. Many other Vietnamese were or continue to be exposed to Agent Orange through contact with the environment and food that was contaminated or as offspring of those exposed who now suffer from illnesses and disabilities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8C7D582CE430497E943C1E2C650EA18C"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Today, there are still dozens of environmental hot spots that continue to contaminate the food, soil, sediment, livestock, and wildlife with Agent Orange.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF380CC2A257C46FFB861B59DCC018183"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Agent Orange exposure continues to negatively affect the lives of men and women in Vietnam and in the United States. The lives of many victims, including Vietnamese, United States veterans and their offspring, and Vietnamese-Americans, are cut short and others live with disease, disabilities, and pain, often untreated or unrecognized.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF153A758DFB2475185790299C845BB0D"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Department of Veterans Affairs recognizes certain illnesses and diseases, including AL amyloidosis, chronic B-cell leukemia, chloracne, diabetes mellitus type 2, Hodgkin’s disease, ischemic heart disease, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Parkinson’s disease, acute and sub-acute peripheral neuropathy, porphyria cutanea tarda, prostate cancer, respiratory cancers, and soft-tissue sarcomas as associated with the spraying and use of Agent Orange by the United States Armed Forces during the Vietnam era.</text>

The list of birth defects covered includes but is not limited to: achondroplasia, cleft lip, cleft palate, congenital heart disease, congenital talipes equinovarus (clubfoot), esophageal and intestinal atresia, Hallerman-Streiff syndrome, hip dysplasia, Hirschsprung's disease (congenital megacolon), hydrocephalus due to aqueductal stenosis, hypospadias, imperforate anus, neural tube defects, Poland syndrome, pyloric stenosis, syndactyly (fused digits), tracheoesophageal fistula, undescended testes, and Williams syndrome. Affected children of these women veterans receive medical care and other benefits.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6AAE8BCD8C7C47EAA93DBB79CFE0E924"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The only birth defect recognized for the children of male American veterans is spina bifida (but not occulta), resulting in most affected children receiving no benefits.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE039F0DFC0E34CD0B880F3FBB05418C0"><enum>(10)</enum><text>The Institute of Medicine for the past several years has noted that <quote>it is considerably more plausible than previously believed that exposure to the herbicides sprayed in Vietnam might have caused paternally mediated transgenerational effects … attributable to the TCCD contaminant in Agent Orange.</quote>. In recent years, scientific studies have identified likely epigenetic links between exposure to toxins and birth defects and developmental disorders in subsequent generations. Some of the children and grandchildren of exposed persons (Americans, Vietnamese, and Vietnamese-Americans) who were in southern Vietnam during the Vietnam era likely suffer from disorders, birth defects, and illnesses related to Agent Orange.</text>
