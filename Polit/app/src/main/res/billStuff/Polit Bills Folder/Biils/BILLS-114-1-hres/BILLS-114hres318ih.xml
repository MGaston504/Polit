 <whereas><text>Whereas the United States and the State of Israel enjoy an affinity and a strategic partnership based on shared democratic values, friendship, and respect;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the President signed the United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act, declaring Israel to be a Major Strategic Partner of the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Israel’s institutions of higher education have played a crucial role in the significant global contributions made by the Jewish state in the fields of science, medicine, and technology, as well as safeguarded principles of academic freedom in providing a forum for the presentation and debate of political and philosophical ideas, including discourse that both supports and opposes the policies of Israel’s Government;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas academic exchanges between Israeli institutions of higher education and institutions of higher education in the United States and around the world redound to the greater benefit of those institutions and the societies of which they are a part through exchange of ideas, sharing of expertise, and providing exposure to diverse perspectives and experiences;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the BDS (Boycott Divestment Sanctions) movement unfairly and misleadingly singles Israel out for criticism and economic pressure, and disregards the moral and legal responsibility of other parties to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the BDS movement seeks to draw institutions of higher learning and scholarly associations into its damaging ambit by pressing for adoption by such institutions and associations of resolutions or policies that formally call for or establish the restriction of discourse, cooperation, exchange, or any other involvement with Israeli academic institutions and scholars;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas resolutions or policies that would limit the freedom to teach, do research in, or otherwise cooperate with academic institutions or scholars from particular countries or regions are themselves contrary to principles of academic freedom; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas commented="no"><text>Whereas the particular calls directed at boycott of Israeli academic institutions and scholars are part of a campaign that hinders the possibility of achieving a fair and just solution and a peaceful settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and applies a double-standard to Israel by singling Israel out for boycott while ignoring the myriad of nation-states whose human rights records fall well short of Israel’s: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
