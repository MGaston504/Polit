 <whereas><text>Whereas the United States needs its leaders to pursue policies in the interest of the United States that are foremost national priorities;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States faces many fiscal and long-term policy challenges that not only threaten the opportunities, hopes, and aspirations of the citizens of the United States, but the overall ability of the United States to be a world leader in bringing peace and stability around the world;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States needs its leaders to unite behind common goals and concrete solutions to create the next generation of growth and opportunity;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a National Strategic Agenda can provide both a long-term vision and a priority list, oriented around common goals for the United States, both of which, as of May 2015, do not exist in the Federal Government;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas adopting a National Strategic Agenda would bring a long-term vision to a policymaking process that has become too often dominated by short-term political considerations;</text>
