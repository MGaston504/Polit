The American Discovery Trail shall be administered by the Secretary of the Interior in cooperation with at least one competent trailwide volunteer-based organization and other affected Federal land managing agencies, and State and local governments, as appropriate. No lands or interests outside the exterior boundaries of federally administered areas may be acquired by the Federal Government solely for the American Discovery Trail. The provisions of sections 7(e), 7(f), and 7(g) shall not apply to the American Discovery Trail.</text></paragraph><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block>

Where the designation of discovery trail is aligned with other units of the National Trails System, or State or local trails, the designation of a discovery trail shall not affect the protections or authorities provided for the other trail or trails, nor shall the designation of a discovery trail diminish the values and significance for which those trails were established. Not later than three complete fiscal years after the date of the enactment of any law designating a national discovery trail, the appropriate Secretary shall submit a comprehensive plan for the protection, management, development, and use of the trail, to the Committee on Natural Resources of the United States House of Representatives and the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the United States Senate. The responsible Secretary shall ensure that the comprehensive plan for the entire trail does not conflict with existing agency direction and shall consult with the affected land managing agencies, the Governors of the affected States, affected county and local political jurisdictions, and local organizations maintaining components of the trail. Components of the comprehensive plan include—</text>

Nothing in this Act may be construed to impose or permit the imposition of any landowner on the use of any non-Federal lands without the consent of the owner thereof. Neither the designation of a national discovery trail nor any plan relating thereto shall affect or be considered in the granting or denial of a right of way or any conditions relating thereto.</text></subparagraph></paragraph></subsection><after-quoted-block>.</after-quoted-block></quoted-block>
