 <paragraph id="HD3D61A5A48774EE78D6A278B8C821CF3"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Individuals with disabilities and significant medical conditions such as Cerebral Palsy, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis, Spinal Cord Injury, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Spina Bifida experience physical, functional, and cognitive challenges every day.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA7881F96F7244C2394E66B5FEA252C60"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Complex rehabilitation technology items (in this Act referred to as <term>CRT items</term>), including products such as complex rehabilitation power wheelchairs, highly configurable manual wheelchairs, adaptive seating and positioning systems, and other specialized equipment, such as standing frames and gait trainers, enable individuals to maximize their function and minimize the extent and costs of their medical care.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H4B955AB734B646B7831B920CE2952876"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Access to CRT items and related services can be threatened by inadequate coding, coverage, and payment policies for such items and services. These policies have restricted access to existing complex rehabilitation technology and stifled innovation. Access challenges have increased over the past several years and, without meaningful change to these policies, will only become greater in the future.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HEA9A4F87C4484F35914157852B3F276B"><enum>(4)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Current Medicare policies often fail to adequately address the needs of individuals with disabilities, to consider the range of services furnished by complex rehabilitation technology suppliers, and to recognize and account for the complexity and unique nature of the equipment itself.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9EEDC178C4514AF987F9002744FE6907"><enum>(5)</enum><text>A significant factor responsible for such access challenges is that individually-configurable CRT items do not have a distinct payment category under the Medicare program, but instead are classified within the broad category of durable medical equipment (DME). CRT items serve patients with serious medical conditions that require a broader range of services and specialized personnel than what is required for standard DME. Individually configured CRT items also require more resources in the areas of configuring, training, and education to ensure appropriate use and to optimize results.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2FD70AD47F7C4EACA302BE64AE57814E"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Unlike most DME, a medical model incorporating an interdisciplinary team approach is necessary to ensure proper individual configuration and use of a CRT item. This team typically includes a physician, a licensed physical or licensed occupational therapist (with no financial relationship with the CRT supplier), a qualified CRT professional, the individual using such item, and sometimes a caregiver for such individual.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC187687499E8441D9FFA46C5DC4D5CF5"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The Medicare program should recognize the specialized nature of the CRT service delivery model, the required supporting processes and technology-related CRT services, the credentials and competencies needed by the providing suppliers and critical staff, and the related costs involved. A separate benefit category for CRT items would allow for unique coding, coverage, and payment rules and policies that address the unique needs of persons with disabilities and acknowledge the extensive service component.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H6F8C0E3DB9B6453D8834C7CB64CC42B0"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Congress and the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services have previously recognized the benefits of a separate classification for unique, individually configured products. In 2008, Congress exempted certain CRT items from inclusion in the Medicare DME competitive bidding program, and Congress has created a separate and distinct benefit category for orthotics and prosthetics (custom braces and artificial limbs), which have their own medical policies, accreditation standards, and payment calculations.</text>
