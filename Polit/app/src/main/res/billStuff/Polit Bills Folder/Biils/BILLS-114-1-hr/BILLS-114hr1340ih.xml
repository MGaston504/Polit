 </paragraph><paragraph id="H039C1001738641A4A3AB5AF93888A8F0"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Up to 70 percent of women in some countries report experiencing gender based violence at some point in their lives.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H56812A3E8E284548819EFB3F2D75F0DB"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Intimate partner violence is the most prevalent form of violence against women, preventing women from playing more active roles in the social, economic, and political development of their communities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H71791E480762443487896323CF791DCF"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Sexual violence among adolescents and pre-adolescents is alarmingly high. National surveys in Swaziland, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Kenya, and Haiti have found that 28 to 38 percent of girls and 9 to 18 percent of boys report experiencing sexual violence before the age of 18.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H59716638F6B2482892B71CA800BE8D0B"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Adult male respondents in 6 countries who had experienced violence as children were significantly more likely to report perpetrating intimate partner violence themselves, according to the International Men and Gender Equality Survey dataset.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFA61EEF7E1024BFAA1B5F39B492D0F51"><enum>(6)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Gender-based violence harms economies and the workers that fuel them. Despite underreporting, striking statistics document prevalent forms of gender-based violence globally that affect the world of work. Worldwide, women are concentrated in low-wage, insecure jobs in workplaces where they lack bargaining power, protections against gender-based violence, safe and confidential reporting systems, recourse to justice, or access to legal, medical, and psychosocial services. Conservative estimates of lost productivity as a result of gender-based violence range from 1.2 percent of GDP in Brazil and Tanzania to 2 percent of GDP in Brazil and Bangladesh.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H61CA1D96DCB048C48333D0DA3A7D9710"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Women living in poverty are particularly vulnerable to gender-based violence. Lack of economic opportunities often compels women to use desperate and dangerous means to provide for themselves and their families, risking significant exposure to sexual exploitation and abuse. These women often cannot afford critical social and medical services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HF7DB785B92964E6A8E2B24B866F93B3B"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Research conducted in India, Colombia, South Africa, and Uganda indicates that when women have greater control of assets, they are less likely to experience intimate partner violence. Additionally, when women participate in the economy they are able to develop a wider support network, which allows them to more easily escape intimate partner violence.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H654DA07CC93E4926801138E030AB716F"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Gender-based violence impacts livelihoods and food security by reducing work capacity and productivity, including the ability to grow food for consumption. Studies have shown that women affected by gender-based violence are exposed to illnesses and injuries that hamper their ability to work productively and care for their families. Diminished food production consequently increases hunger and women’s vulnerability to further violence.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB58BC77AC23B4F53949F08E8C6928BBD"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Country studies indicate that the risk of HIV among women who have experienced violence may be up to 3 times higher than among those who have not. The World Health Organization found that women who experience intimate partner violence are at over 50 percent greater risk of HIV infection, and in some instances their risk increases four-fold. Women living with HIV are more likely to experience violence than other women, and fear of violence can prevent women from accessing HIV/AIDS information and receiving treatment and counseling.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9B9D29768CDE454C951AE39E7D744C73"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Addressing gender norms and inequities is essential to reducing HIV risk and increasing access to HIV prevention, care and treatment services for women and men. The President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) supports significant work in the field to incorporate efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence into existing HIV treatment and prevention programs. In fiscal year 2012, PEPFAR investments reached 720,000 people in 11 countries with services or interventions that explicitly addressed gender-based violence and coercion.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H2A05E98B5C4C4C688804715347E58EE2"><enum>(12)</enum><text>Prevalence of sexual violence is higher among persons with disabilities, particularly for adolescents and intimate partners with disabilities, and for men and women with intellectual impairments living in institutions. The World Health Organization reports that rates of gender-based violence are 4–10 times greater among persons with disabilities than non-disabled persons.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB2B7708304224B91AB14F544A15FCCB9"><enum>(13)</enum><text>Displaced, refugee, and stateless women and girls in humanitarian emergencies, conflict settings, and natural disasters face extreme violence and threats, including—</text>

 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H2FD5B8CDAF33432AAC13B50A8BF2600A"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Rape and sexual assault against women and girls are used to torture, intimidate, and terrorize communities. Rape and sexual assault are used as tools of war in conflict zones including Democratic Republic of Congo, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Colombia, and South Sudan. A 2011 study found that 48 women were raped every hour in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</text>

These factors become particularly acute in conflict and disaster settings where fears of sexual violence often drive early, child and forced marriage.</text>
 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="HB33ACE641DA34B67B6724C310D240E56"><enum>(16)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) is carried out most often on girls between infancy and age fifteen and has impacted more than 125 million girls and women alive today. FGM/C can cause long-term health problems including infertility, complications in childbirth, and increased risk of newborn deaths.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H58AD5F10A24B4E62A797AD28DDFEEC3D"><enum>(17)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">World Bank data shows that gender inequality directly corresponds to increased levels of political and economic instability within countries. Gender-based violence impedes women’s meaningful participation in social, political, and economic spheres, which is essential to the stability and democratization of a country. Since women disproportionately experience gender-based violence during conflict and post-conflict reconstruction, they can play a pivotal role in preventing, mitigating, resolving conflict, and countering extremism, evidenced in contexts including Northern Ireland and Liberia.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HE7BC841904194FA19CF08F3B964D5EF9"><enum>(18)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Gender-based violence is a contributing factor to human trafficking. Experts in the field have reported that women and girls who have experienced gender-based violence and live in societies that tolerate severe gender discrimination appear to be more vulnerable to being trafficked. Comprehensive efforts to reduce human trafficking must include efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence due to the intertwined relationship of the two crimes.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H20F44152C92C47CF8EDBC2A19BB9A492"><enum>(19)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Faith-based organizations and faith leaders have an important role to play in the ongoing efforts to prevent and respond to gender-based violence. Where engaged as genuine partners and equipped with knowledge and resources, they can yield great gains. In countries that lack effective legal frameworks to address gender-based violence, they have the standing and authority to address harmful practices such as acid throwing.</text>
