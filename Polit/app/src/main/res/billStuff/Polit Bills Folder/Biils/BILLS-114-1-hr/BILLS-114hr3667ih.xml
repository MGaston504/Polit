 <text>Catherine Bertini, the former United Nations Under-Secretary General for Management and director of the World Food Program (WFP), has stated that <quote>Voluntary funding creates an entirely different atmosphere at WFP than at the UN. At WFP, every staff member knows that we have to be as efficient, accountable, transparent, and results-oriented as possible. If we are not, donor governments can take their funding elsewhere in a very competitive world among UN agencies, NGOs, and bilateral governments.</quote>.</text>

 <text>John Bolton, former United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations, has stated that <quote>Moving to voluntary funding would end the UN practice of charging member states for the expenses of the UN and its activities.

The shift toward a voluntary payment system would impose a stronger market incentive for UN programs and activities to meet their goals and justify continued funding.</quote>.</text>
