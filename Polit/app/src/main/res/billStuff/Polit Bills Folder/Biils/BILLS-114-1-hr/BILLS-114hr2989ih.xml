 <paragraph id="H26366C89AE8F415DBD64AD2494A14062"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In December 2013, tensions between political leaders sparked a new civil conflict in South Sudan that has killed tens of thousands, displaced an estimated two million people, including over 500,000 refugees, and left 4.6 million people—40 percent of the population—facing the threat of extreme hunger and in need of immediate humanitarian assistance.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H886026F8C2584B8887CFC7C5CD2AAA25"><enum>(5)</enum><text>While representatives of the warring parties agreed in the January 21, 2015, Arusha Communique that they bear full responsibility for South Sudan’s crisis and that those individuals responsible for atrocities should be held accountable, no party to the conflict has taken credible steps to hold any senior civilian or military leader to account, and instead continue to commit atrocities with impunity.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD7B400E4912747EDB0295FCE9CB02DAE"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Eight commitments and recommitments to cease hostilities have been broken, and the most recent round of peace talks held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) from January 2014 through March 5, 2015, failed to bring meaningful progress to end the war.</text>

The Administration has already designated four individuals under this order, two from the Government of South Sudan and two from the opposition. Canada and the European Union have implemented similar regimes.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5EC98A38BD874B909D81CBC05C54E939"><enum>(14)</enum><text>The date July 9, 2015, should signify and celebrate South Sudan’s independence and peaceful recovery from decades of war, yet the violence against children in South Sudan has reached a new level of brutality. Children are being aggressively recruited into armed groups on both sides of the conflict and forced to participate in a conflict not of their making. The psychological and physical effects on these children must be recognized and addressed and this violence against the innocent must stop immediately.</text>
