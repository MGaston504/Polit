	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas working parents depend on high-quality childcare so they can work and support their families;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas over 60 percent of children under 5, and ½ of grade school-aged children, are in a regular childcare arrangement;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas United States businesses lose $3,000,000,000 annually due to employee absenteeism resulting from child care challenges, which weakens the stable and reliable childcare system that is essential for the economy;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas childcare is difficult to find for millions of families, particularly the nearly 9,000,000 parents who work non-standard hours, because only 8 percent of childcare centers provide evening or weekend care;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas most middle-class families struggle to afford high-quality childcare;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the median annual aggregate cost of full-time care for an infant and a 4-year-old in a childcare center is nearly $16,000;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the average annual cost of center-based childcare for an infant is over ½ of the income of a family of 3 living at the poverty level in 21 States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas high-quality childcare and early education, especially for disadvantaged children, helps children thrive in school and beyond by—</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the CCDBG serves only a fraction of families eligible for Federal support, with only 17 percent of eligible children receiving Federal childcare assistance, the lowest percentage since 1997;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas these issues affect all families, but disproportionately affect women because—</text> <paragraph id="idAD1B39D61B654377A3D53D713E70B526"><enum>(1)</enum><text>over 95 percent of the formal childcare workforce is comprised of women; and</text>

 </paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas increased pay for workers in the childcare industry improves the quality of childcare for young children;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas to recruit and retain a qualified childcare workforce for young children, childcare staff for young children should be paid as much as K–12 staff with equivalent education and experience;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a full-time living wage of at least $15 per hour is needed for childcare workers to meet the essential needs of their families, but the average childcare center worker earns $10.60 per hour and has experienced no increase in real earnings since 1997;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas high-quality childcare that works for everyone is essential for a strong economy and future;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas each working family needs, in order to support its well-being—</text> <paragraph id="id6E655404ABA84A08B32B1ED2C464B568"><enum>(1)</enum><text>universal preschool;</text>
