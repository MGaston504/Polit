 <whereas><text>Whereas, prior to the landmark decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Griswold v. Connecticut, 381 U.S. 479 (1965), married women in many States were lawfully forbidden from using family planning tools such as contraceptives and condoms;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the historic Griswold case provided precedent for future cases in the Supreme Court that extended the right to use contraceptives to all women, regardless of marital status;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, since Griswold, millions of women have used contraceptives to plan pregnancies, resulting in healthier women, healthier pregnancies, healthier families, and greater financial security for families;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, despite having the legal right to use contraceptives, many women who need family planning and sexual health services still face financial and other barriers to getting the necessary care;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, because of limited access to affordable family planning services, low-income women are 5 times more likely to have an unintended pregnancy compared to women with higher incomes, and unintended pregnancy rates are increasing for poor and low-income women while decreasing for women with higher incomes;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Black and Latino women are disproportionately affected by the lack of access to contraceptives and reproductive health care;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas programs such as the population research and voluntary family planning programs under title X of the Public Health Service Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/300">42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.</external-xref>) and the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/1396">42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.</external-xref>) help low-income women access high-quality, affordable family planning care, including contraceptives, that helps women plan pregnancies and stay healthy;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/111/148">Public Law 111–148</external-xref>) is helping realize the promise of Griswold by removing barriers to care by requiring that all insurance providers offer contraceptives and reproductive preventive health care services at no cost to women, and, as of 2014, more than 55,000,000 women were benefitting from coverage without cost-sharing for preventive services, including birth control, according to the Department of Health and Human Services;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, each year, publicly funded contraceptives and family planning services help prevent approximately 2,000,000 unplanned pregnancies, 800,000 abortions, 400,000 miscarriages, and 200,000 pre-term and low birth rate births;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, in 2015, the Institute of Medicine listed using birth control to reduce unintended pregnancies as 1 of 15 core measures for furthering health progress and improving health;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, as the number of contraceptive methods expands, it is more important than ever that all women have access to the full range of contraceptive methods, including the most effective methods, so that each woman can choose the method that works best for her; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas every dollar invested in publicly funded contraceptive saves taxpayers $7.09: Now, therefore, be it</text>
