 <paragraph id="HCEB1704941F4482BBEBB8CAB1DC0FD5A"><enum>(1)</enum><text>College costs have increased tremendously over the past decade. When adjusted for inflation, the average published price for in-State students at public four-year universities is 42-percent higher than it was a decade ago and more than twice as high as it was 20 years ago. The price of private nonprofit four-year institutions has increased 24 percent during the last 10 years and 66 percent during the last 20 years.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC8B3A94A409E4A908EF554B731DFBEC5"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Federal financial aid for students has also increased rapidly but failed to mitigate the issues of rising college costs. Between the 2003–2004 academic year and the 2013–2014 academic year, the amount of Federal financial aid in the form of Pell Grants, Federal student aid, campus based aid, veterans educational benefits, and tax credits increased from $73.5 billion to $164.5 billion or by 124 percent beyond the rate of inflation. The Federal Government’s share of total student aid is 69 percent.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H668F7FBDD86546B3AE8891257E99B470"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Students continue to borrow more than they can afford. During the 2012–2013 academic year, approximately 60 percent of students who earned bachelor’s degrees from the public and private nonprofit institutions at which they began their studies graduated with debt. These students borrowed an average of $27,300, an increase of 13 percent compared to 5 years ago and an increase of 19 percent compared to 10 years ago.</text>
