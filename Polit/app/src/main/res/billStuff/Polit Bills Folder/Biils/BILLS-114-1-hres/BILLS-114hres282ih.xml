 <whereas><text>Whereas 500,000 families in the United States live with bladder cancer;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas more than 74,000 people are expected to be diagnosed with bladder cancer and 16,000 will die due to the disease in 2015 alone;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas bladder cancer affects people of all ages and backgrounds and is among the top 10 cancers with the highest incidence rates in the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas bladder cancer is known as one of the most expensive cancers to treat on a per patient basis with a recurrence rate of approximately 50 to 80 percent, requiring lifelong surveillance;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas bladder cancer symptoms, such as blood in the urine, are easily recognized, however, many are unaware of the threat of bladder cancer, often prolonging time to diagnosis;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas if diagnosed early, bladder cancer is treatable;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas military veterans are twice as likely as non-veterans to be diagnosed with bladder cancer;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas women are often diagnosed at a later stage in the development of bladder cancer, and when diagnosed at the same stage as men, women have a worse prognosis;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas if diagnosis and treatment are delayed, the life expectancy of an individual with bladder cancer decreases;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the quality of life of a person with bladder cancer will depend on future treatment and diagnosis developments, which will rely on research advancements;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas there have been no new treatments developed for bladder cancer in more than 20 years;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas research advancements for bladder cancer are limited by lack of awareness about the disease within the medical community and general public;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas increased awareness will promote early diagnosis and increase chances of survival;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas increased awareness will bolster public support of the disease and thus increase funding for innovative research and the development of new treatment options and diagnostic tools;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas traditionally on the first Saturday in May, survivors, caregivers, and loved ones walk together throughout the United States to raise awareness of bladder cancer;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network and its community of patients, caregivers, and specialists, seek to foster a community of hope and support, fund and conduct research for innovative treatments and diagnostic tools, and increase public awareness and understanding of bladder cancer; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas May would be an appropriate month to designate as “National Bladder Cancer Awareness Month”: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
