 <paragraph id="H75AE8BC710D042C9B9896C56BECD12DC"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Pregnancy is a significant life event for millions of women in the United States each year.</text> </paragraph><paragraph id="H10AB1BB920BD488B8FBF4C86EFE6C64F"><enum>(2)</enum><text>For more than 30 years, our Nation, through the Medicaid program, has recognized that pregnant women need immediate access to affordable care, and has allowed women who meet income-eligibility requirements to enroll in Medicaid coverage when they become pregnant.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H428588B4E79A4A68B866122F8658882B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Congress recognized the central importance of maternity coverage by classifying maternity and newborn care as one of the ten essential health benefits that must now be covered on most individual and small group health insurance plans under section 1302(b)(1) of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/18022">42 U.S.C. 18022(b)(1)</external-xref>).</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8084B8184E9942AE90179C791A9AA24F"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Access to comprehensive maternity coverage allows women to access important pregnancy-related care, which is demonstrated to improve health outcomes for women and newborns and reduce financial costs for both consumers and insurers.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9505174B82A6422AA07E716908006AFC"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Uninsured women, women with grandfathered and transitional health plans, self-funded student health plans, and catastrophic and high-deductible health plans may lack access to comprehensive and affordable maternity coverage.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0ED0B99DA9B44A4DA44827035563F2FF"><enum>(6)</enum><text>A special enrollment period is especially important for young adults, who are at high risk for unintended pregnancies, yet young adults are frequently enrolled in catastrophic coverage, which often has fewer benefits, more restrictions, and higher deductibles.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H75AB7165C55948A6974CD9F39C1A408D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Timely maternity care improves the health of pregnant women, as well as birth outcomes and the health of babies throughout their lifetimes. Pregnancy-related maternal mortality is three to four times higher among women who receive no maternity care compared to women who do. Regular maternity care can detect or mitigate serious pregnancy-related health complications, including preeclampsia, placental abruption, complications from diabetes, complications from heart disease, and Graves’ disease, all of which can result in morbidity or mortality for the mother or newborn.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H24BCBF8AD68A494CADEDB97CA5A6D3D0"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Regular maternity care can reduce preterm births and the health complications associated with preterm births.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H0E0CEECEBBBF4837B30E2EC414ADE2B0"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Timely maternity care can reduce short- and long-term health care costs. If a woman does not have access to affordable maternity care during her pregnancy, and she or her newborn experiences pregnancy complications that result in health problems after birth, their insurer may end up paying much higher costs than if the insurer had covered the woman’s maternity care during her pregnancy. Intensive maternity care can reduce hospital and neonatal intensive care unit admissions among infants, resulting in cost savings of $1,768 to $5,560 per birth. For women with high-risk pregnancies, intensive maternity care saves $1.37 for every $1 invested in maternity care.</text>
