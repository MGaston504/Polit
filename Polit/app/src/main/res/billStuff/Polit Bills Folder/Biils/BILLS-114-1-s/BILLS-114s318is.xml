It supports researchers in every State as they discover treatments and cures to prevent and reduce human suffering. Thanks in large part to NIH-funded medical research, Americans today are living longer and healthier. Life expectancy in the United States has jumped from 47 years in 1900 to 78 years in 2009, and disability in people over age 65 has dropped dramatically in the past 3 decades.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idd23ed88bc95a4583833a07b3667b2809"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Over the past 40 years, NIH-supported research contributed to the discovery of 153 new Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs, vaccines, or new indications for current drugs.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id0c3d61902ad1421a86dd7c9ee1cbf757"><enum>(3)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The application success rate is now at an all-time low.

Only the United States has decreased its investment, from 0.215 percent of Gross Domestic Product in 2003 (the last year of the doubling) to 0.174 percent in 2013. In 8 years, if current trends continue, China will surpass the United States in total government biomedical research investment.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idb57c1533b09a4e26a4d27bb57242293b"><enum>(5)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">NIH is vital to the United States economy.

Recent estimates indicate that the economic costs of Alzheimer’s disease is over $200,000,000,000 each year but will rise to over $1,000,000,000,000 by 2050 unless a prevention or cure is found. In 2006, economists found that a future 1 percent reduction in mortality rates from cancer would save $500,000,000,000 to current and future Americans. A cure for cancer was estimated to save $50,000,000,000,000 to Americans, more than 3 times the gross domestic product of the United States in 2012. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that annual costs from undiagnosed diabetes was $245,000,000,000 each year. And a recent study projects that by 2030, nearly 44 percent of the United States population will face some form of cardiovascular disease costing a total of $1,208,000,000,000 between 2012 and 2030.</text></paragraph><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idefb1b77a5d6d44d78c186cb288a65c31"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Budget cap adjustments are how Congress traditionally prioritizes areas of spending that produce economic growth and reduce costs that contribute to the Federal debt.</text></paragraph></section><section commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="id3137835526ac44828dd8588a4430c52a" section-type="subsequent-section"><enum>3.</enum><header display-inline="yes-display-inline">Cap adjustment</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Section 251(b)(2) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/2/901">2 U.S.C. 901(b)(2)</external-xref>) is amended—</text><paragraph commented="no" display-inline="no-display-inline" id="idF7E357BF0FB34F6FBD68311B905C4CAD"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">by redesignating subparagraph (D) as subparagraph (E);
