	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas Sickle Cell Disease is the most common inherited blood disorder in the United States, affecting approximately 100,000 people in the United States;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas more than 3,000,000 people in the United States have the Sickle Cell Trait and many are unaware of their status;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas African-Americans (1 in 12) and Hispanic Americans (1 in 100) are most at risk for carrying the Sickle Cell Trait, and the trait has been found in persons of Greek, Italian, East Indian, Saudi Arabian, Asian, Syrian, Turkish, Cypriot, Sicilian, and Caucasian origin;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas individuals who have Sickle Cell Trait have a 50-percent chance of passing on the abnormal sickle cell gene to future offspring and 25-percent chance of having future children with Sickle Cell Disease if both parents have the trait;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas individuals with Sickle Cell Trait have the same life expectancy as the general population, but are at risk for certain conditions including, blood in the urine, kidney cancer, complications with trauma to the eye, tissue death in the spleen at high altitudes, or may have a false positive A1C test;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to a 2007 study in the American Journal of Medical Genetics, all States have been required to screen for Sickle Cell Disease/Trait since 2006, however, most States lack a protocol for disseminating results of trait status, with parents being notified only 37 percent of the time;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas communication of a screening result consistent with Sickle Cell Trait should always be accompanied by appropriate counseling on the implications, provided by an individual with adequate training and understanding of the information;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the limited research on the communication of Sickle Cell Trait test results to patients demonstrates that there is a high prevalence of misleading information being communicated during counseling sessions for Sickle Cell Trait following newborn screening by clinicians;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas no studies have examined whether information on Sickle Cell Trait test results are being accurately transmitted to an individual, whether by a family member or healthcare provider, prior to a person’s reproductive years; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress recognizes the importance of ensuring that people in the United States can make informed decisions as a result of awareness of their Sickle Cell Trait status: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
