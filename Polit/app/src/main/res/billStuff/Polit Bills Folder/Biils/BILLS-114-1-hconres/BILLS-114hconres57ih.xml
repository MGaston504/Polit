 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas appropriate use of tests such as Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) exams and blood pressure and cholesterol screens, in conjunction with clinical examination and self-testing for problems such as testicular cancer, can result in the detection of many of these problems in their early stages and increases in the survival rates to nearly 100 percent;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas June 15 through June 21, 2015, is National Men’s Health Week, which has the purpose of heightening the awareness of preventable health problems and encouraging early detection and treatment of disease among men and boys: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
