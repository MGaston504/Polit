 <whereas><text>Whereas the Perkins Loan Program is the Nationâ€™s longest running Federal student loan program, created in 1958 as the National Defense Student Loan Program and later called the National Direct Loan Program;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Perkins Loans are efficient, need-based, low-interest loans that serve 500,000 low-income college students with high need at some 1,500 colleges and universities each year;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Perkins Loans have favorable terms for students; for example, interest is not charged while students are in school, the interest rate is low and fixed, and borrowers may have all or part of their Perkins Loans cancelled if they undertake certain public service jobs for one to five years;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas participating schools share the risk of the Perkins Loan Program because they provide a one-third match to Federal capital contributions, and loans are made using funds repaid by previous borrowers;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Perkins Loans features the human touch of campus-based servicing, which allows on-campus administrators to provide Perkins borrowers with one-on-one service;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Perkins loans have made higher education possible for millions of Americans; and</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas without Perkins Loans, thousands of Americans will lose the chance at higher education and a better life: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
