In the Financial Report, the Treasury Department summarized: <quote>Since the passage of the CFO Act of 1990, the federal financial community has made important strides in instilling strong accounting and financial reporting practices. In 2014, 23 of the 24 CFO Act agencies obtained an opinion from the independent auditors on their financial statements. Out of the 24 major <quote>CFO Act</quote> agencies, there were 22 clean opinions, 1 qualified opinion, and only one remaining disclaimer in FY 2013. … However, weaknesses in basic financial management practices and other limitations continue to prevent one major agency, and the Government as a whole, from achieving an audit opinion.</quote>.</text></paragraph>
