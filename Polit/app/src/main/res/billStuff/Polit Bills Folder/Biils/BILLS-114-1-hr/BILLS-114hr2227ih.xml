<paragraph id="H54C888B36CB24E50906B1960BDBC5AEA"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Extreme weather has serious economic costs for Americans, American businesses, and State and local governments. Hurricanes, droughts, floods, tornadoes, extreme heat, and extreme cold cause death, result in loss of property and well-being, especially among the most vulnerable populations, and negatively impact business activity and economic growth.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H6890F3C3EB7B4982822F736A6241F6BB"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Superstorm Sandy, which devastated the Eastern United States in late October 2012, resulted in more than 100 deaths, the evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people from their homes, power outages affecting more than 8,500,000 homes, massive flooding, gasoline shortages, and a crippled regional energy and transportation infrastructure. As a result of this storm, Congress passed the Disaster Relief Appropriations Act, 2013, which appropriated $50,500,000,000 for post-Sandy recovery efforts.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H16028A11E242450F8EC476A45D67DB5F"><enum>(3)</enum><text>In the past 30 years, there have been more than 130 weather-related disasters in the United States that each generated at least $1,000,000,000 in damages or more than $880,000,000,000 in total standardized loss. In addition, there have been many other extreme weather events that generated less than $1,000,000,000 in damages, but still caused immeasurable harm to the Nation’s citizens, infrastructure, and economy.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H18DF42D2EFFC463EAF278B4A568E6045"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Hurricane Katrina led to more than 1,800 deaths, property damage exceeding $80,000,000,000, more than $120,000,000,000 in Federal spending, and long-term impacts on the economy and livelihoods of those living in the Gulf Coast region.</text></paragraph>

<paragraph id="HB28A403EFB0B4F3D8CEAB6334997F120"><enum>(6)</enum><text>In 2012, in addition to Superstorm Sandy, the United States experienced—</text> <subparagraph id="H5C29FB945C554EBEBA022191B60A4E1C"><enum>(A)</enum><text>drought conditions in more than 60 percent of the contiguous United States at the peak of the drought, including more than 2,200 counties that have received disaster designations from the Secretary of Agriculture due to the drought;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="H9E4DBC22A21D47CB8320E07230802A5B"><enum>(B)</enum><text>deadly floods in Minnesota, Tropical Storm Debby in Florida, and Hurricane Isaac in Louisiana;</text></subparagraph> <subparagraph id="HA4AA82EBBF984D92B4FD10C47B4FFAC1"><enum>(C)</enum><text>destructive wildfires on more than 9,000,000 acres across 37 States;</text></subparagraph> 
<subparagraph id="HB5AA84B20F4F4989A04B01E49635943B"><enum>(D)</enum><text>power outages affecting more than 3,400,000 homes due to severe storms during the summer; and</text></subparagraph> <subparagraph id="H909CAB4C8EB14972840EFF9F02B0575F"><enum>(E)</enum><text>deadly heat waves, highlighted by July as the warmest month on record for the contiguous United States and more than 9,600 daily high temperature records broken during June, July, and August.</text></subparagraph></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H5BA192EFA4654047A7F2EE044B8A9AFB"><enum>(7)</enum><text>These events and natural disaster trends, when combined with the volatility of weather, ongoing demographic changes, and development in high risk areas, indicate that the negative impacts of extreme weather events and natural disasters have the potential to increase over time. The fact that a significant number of people and assets continue to be located in areas prone to volatile and extreme weather indicates that these events will continue to be expensive and deadly if the United States fails to enhance its resiliency to such events. Recent studies show that the intensity and frequency of some types of, but not all, extreme weather events will likely increase in the future.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H72EBCFA30D7F4451AE7D48C88400E082"><enum>(8)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Economic savings can be achieved by considering the impacts of extreme weather over the short- and long-term in the planning process. For example, a 2005 review of the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s hazard mitigation programs, conducted by the National Institute of Building Sciences’ Multi-Hazard Mitigation Council, found that every dollar spent on hazard mitigation yields a savings of $4 in future losses.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HB2A3A49E079D4C429A4A0EF13C387E38"><enum>(9)</enum><text>There are several efforts currently underway at the Federal, regional, tribal, State, and local levels that have helped lay the foundation for a federally coordinated effort to increase the Nation’s resiliency to extreme weather events, such as the Hurricane Sandy Rebuilding Task Force, the Presidential Policy Directive on National Preparedness (referred to in this Act as <quote>PPD–8</quote>), the National Preparedness System, the whole community approach led by the Department of Homeland Security, and the Silver Jackets Program by the Army Corps of Engineers. Other recent reports on this subject include the National Academies of Sciences’ reports <quote>Disaster Resilience: A National Imperative</quote> and <quote>Building Community Disaster Resilience through Public-Private Collaboration</quote>.</text></paragraph></subsection> <subsection id="H011441753B4C48D78EAEC14FE057025E"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purpose</header><text>The purpose of this Act is to minimize the economic and social costs and future losses of life, property, well-being, business activity, and economic growth by making the United States more resilient to the impacts of extreme weather events over the short- and long-term, thereby creating business and job growth opportunities by—</text>
