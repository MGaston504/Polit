 <paragraph id="H5BF2D12F31E74A808374864B38E14EAD"><enum>(1)</enum><text>The Congressional Budget Office reports on any overall financial surplus or shortfall in the funding provided for the Federal Pell Grant program. However, in recent years, in order to meet the maximum Federal Pell Grant level with the provided level of funding, Congress has made cuts to the program through imposing additional eligibility requirements for Federal Pell Grants and limiting the availability of year-round Federal Pell Grants, causing significant uncertainty and reducing access to higher education for millions of hardworking college students.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H844B4CBCFCB346C4938627BC7C984F59"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The <quote>traditional student</quote> who attends college for 4 years immediately after high school is now a minority of college students today. Ambitious students now need more flexibility to attend school year-round while juggling work schedules.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9BFE5544816345058869775141F3E0DF"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Section 1860 of the Department of Defense and Full-Year Continuing Appropriations Act, 2011 (<external-xref legal-doc="public-law" parsable-cite="pl/112/10">Public Law 112–10</external-xref>, 125 Stat. 169) eliminated the provision of the Federal Pell Grant program of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/20/1070a">20 U.S.C. 1070a et seq.</external-xref>) that allowed more than one Federal Pell Grant awards per year, creating significant hardship for many students trying to take courses over the summer or outside the traditional school calendar. Allowing students to continue to receive Federal Pell Grants in successive semesters, without a gap, would reduce the time needed to complete their degrees.</text>
