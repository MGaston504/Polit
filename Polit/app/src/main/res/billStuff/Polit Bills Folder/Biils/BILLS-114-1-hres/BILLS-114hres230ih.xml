	<preamble>
 <whereas><text>Whereas sexual assault is a transgression against the dignity, bodily integrity, and fundamental rights of human beings;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Department of Justice reports that 300,170 people in the United States are sexually assaulted each year, which is the equivalent of one person every 105 seconds;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sexual assault is a vastly underreported crime in the United States, with the Rape, Abuse, Incest, National Network estimating that fewer than one in three survivors report the attack to law enforcement;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that one in five women in the United States will be the victim of an attempted or completed rape in her lifetime;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas sexual assault affects women, men, and children of all racial, social, religious, age, ethnic, and economic groups;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas notice and access to information, fair and efficient legal procedures, responsible and accountable survivor advocacy, and fair administration and efficient processing of sexual assault evidence collection kits (<quote>rape kits</quote>) are, among others, fundamental rights for survivors;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas notice and access to information are necessary to inform survivors of critical matters, including their basic legal rights, the contents of their law enforcement report, the availability of local rape crisis centers, and the final disposition of their case;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas fair and efficient legal procedures are essential to protect survivors against unreasonable barriers that obstruct entry into the justice system and to empower survivors and thereby reduce the underreporting of sexual assault;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas responsible and accountable survivor advocacy is critical to prevent unintentional secondary traumatization of survivors;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the fair administration and efficient processing of rape kits are vital to eliminate the national backlog of hundreds of thousands of unsubmitted and untested rape kits;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas all citizens should have an opportunity to avail themselves of these crucial rights, which currently only some States formally recognize by law;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas not having comprehensive and survivor-centered legal and civil protections in place can result in obstruction of justice for survivors, re-victimization of the survivor, and a deterrence of survivors to come forward;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas people in every State urgently deserve a comprehensive Sexual Assault Survivors’ Bill of Rights so that access to justice does not depend on geography;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government is a global leader in protecting its people’s rights to liberty and equality; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas April is recognized as “National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month”: Now, therefore, be it</text></whereas></preamble>
