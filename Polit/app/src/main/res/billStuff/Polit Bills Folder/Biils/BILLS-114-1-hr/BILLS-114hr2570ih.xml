 <paragraph id="H90F46AA70C864CD389FF9301ED90B0AA"><enum>(1)</enum><text>A growing body of evidence demonstrates that increases in patient-level financial barriers (including deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance) for high-value medical services (such as prescription medications, clinician visits, diagnostic tests, and procedures) systematically reduce their use. Savings attributable to cost-related decreased utilization of specific services may lead to an increase in total medical expenditures due to increased use of other related clinical services, such as hospitalizations and emergency room visits.</text>
