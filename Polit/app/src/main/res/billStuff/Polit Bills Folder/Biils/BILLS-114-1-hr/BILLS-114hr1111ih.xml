The United Nations declared the years 2001 through 2010 an International Decade for a Culture of Peace and Non-Violence for the Children of the World and the United Nations supports a culture of peace going forward.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7425BC096DAA49E885CDD9E13CAA6EB5"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">On April 4, 2012, the Institute for Economics and Peace released a United States Peace Index, which assessed peacefulness at the State and city levels and analyzed the costs associated with violence and the socio-economic measures associated with peace. While violence within the United States had declined over the year 2011, violence and violence containment still cost the average taxpayer $3,257. The total cost of violence to the United States—including lost productivity from violence—was conservatively calculated to be over $460 billion.</text></paragraph>

The study included government, corporate, and individual expenditure, regardless of whether it was related to international affairs such as offshore military activities, or domestic spending such as dealing with crime and the consequences of crime.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H7C50F8B229444298A70CB61121015688"><enum>(9)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Violence prevention is cost effective. For every dollar spent in violence prevention and peacebuilding, many lives and many dollars are saved. The philosophy and techniques of nonviolence and the science of peacebuilding provide tools and techniques that can be applied not only at the levels of individual and community growth, but also within the Federal Government and at national and international levels.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HFE63E7B8D7BE48E8A607B3BF07BF4DAE"><enum>(10)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Peacebuilding is defined by the United Nations as a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management, and to lay the foundations for sustainable peace and development. Peacebuilding is built upon research into the root causes of violence in the United States and the world, through promotion and promulgation of effective policies and programs that ameliorate those root causes of violence, and through providing all citizens, organizations, and governmental bodies with opportunities to learn about and practice the essential tools of nonviolent conflict resolution and peacebuilding.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HBA04C4D09BB54698A732A3FC3044223A"><enum>(11)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2000, the Earth Charter Commission released the Earth Charter, an international declaration of fundamental values and principles created to build a just, sustainable, and peaceful global society. The preamble of the Earth Charter provides, <quote>To move forward we must recognize that in the midst of a magnificent diversity of cultures and life forms we are one human family and one Earth community with a common destiny. We must join together to bring forth a sustainable global society founded on respect for nature, universal human rights, economic justice, and a culture of peace.</quote> Peacebuilding is working together with all nations to protect both life and land and hold the Earth in balance.</text></paragraph></section>
