 <whereas><text>Whereas, on April 25, 2015, an earthquake measuring 7.8 on the Richter scale and the aftershocks of the earthquake devastated Kathmandu, Nepal and the surrounding areas, killing thousands, injuring thousands more people, and leaving many thousands of people homeless;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the earthquake also resulted in the loss of life and destruction of property in India, Bangladesh, and the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas United States citizens were also killed in the wide-scale destruction caused by the earthquake;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Nepal, which is one of the poorest countries in the world, has an estimated 25 percent of the population living on less than $1.25 a day, has an estimated 46 percent unemployment rate with a majority of the population engaged in subsistence agriculture, and has one of the slowest economic growth rates in the region;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas years of civil conflict in Nepal led to a massive influx of people into urban areas despite the absence of appropriate facilities, roads, housing, and infrastructure to support the people;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, since the end of hostilities, political gridlock among the leadership of Nepal to finalize a constitution has stymied growth and development;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the loss of infrastructure will further inhibit economic growth in the impoverished country of Nepal;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government has worked with the Government of Nepal on disaster risk reduction and earthquake preparedness for years, which certainly saved many lives and accelerated the ability of the Government and people of Nepal to respond to disasters and earthquakes;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Government and the international community are mounting a large-scale response and recovery effort; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the United States Agency for International Development is leading the response of the United States by providing a Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART), funding, and Urban Search and Rescue experts: Now, therefore, be it</text>
