No public housing agency shall be granted this designation through this section that administers in excess of 22,000 aggregate housing vouchers and public housing units. Of the agencies selected under this section, no less than 150 shall administer 600 or fewer aggregate housing voucher and public housing units, no less than 125 shall administer 601–5,000 aggregate housing voucher and public housing units, and no more than 20 shall administer 5,001–22,000 aggregate housing voucher and public housing units. Of the 300 agencies selected under this section, five shall be agencies with portfolio awards under the Rental Assistance Demonstration that meet the other requirements of this section. Selection of agencies under this section shall be based on ensuring the geographic diversity of Moving-to-Work agencies. The Secretary may, at the request of a Moving-to-Work agency and one or more adjacent public housing agencies in the same area, designate that Moving-to-Work agency as a regional agency. A regional Moving-to-Work agency may administer the assistance under sections 8 and 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f and g) for the participating agencies within its region pursuant to the terms of its Moving-to-Work agreement with the Secretary. The Secretary may agree to extend the term of the agreement and to make any necessary changes to accommodate regionalization. A Moving-to-Work agency may be selected as a regional agency if the Secretary determines that unified administration of assistance under sections 8 and 9 by that agency across multiple jurisdictions will lead to efficiencies and to greater housing choice for low-income persons in the region. For purposes of this expansion, in addition to the provisions of the Act retained in section 204, section 8(r)(1) of the Act shall continue to apply unless the Secretary determines that waiver of this section is necessary to implement comprehensive rent reform and occupancy policies subject to evaluation by the Secretary, and the waiver contains, at a minimum, exceptions for requests to port due to employment, education, health and safety. No public housing agency granted this designation through this section shall receive more funding under sections 8 or 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 than it otherwise would have received absent this designation. The Secretary shall extend the current Moving-to-Work agreements of previously designated participating agencies until the end of each such agency’s fiscal year 2028 under the same terms and conditions of such current agreements, except for any changes to such terms or conditions otherwise mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and any such agency and such extension agreements shall prohibit any statutory offset of any reserve balances equal to four months of operating expenses. Any such reserve balances that exceed such amount shall remain available to any such agency for all permissible purposes under such agreement unless subject to a statutory offset. In addition to other reporting requirements, all Moving-to-Work agencies shall report financial data to the Department of Housing and Urban Development as specified by the Secretary, so that the effect of Moving-to-Work policy changes can be measured.</text>
