 <whereas><text>Whereas private equity and growth capital is an industry that partners with pensions, foundations, and endowments to invest over the long term in promising companies in need of a turnaround and poised for growth;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private equity invested more than $522,000,000,000 in United States-based businesses last year and more than $4,577,000,000,000 over the past 10 years;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private equity partnerships help bring together management expertise with investment capital;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas low taxes on long-term capital gains income is a fundamental part of fostering long-term investment in the United States, and private equity relies on long-term capital gains income to incentivize investment;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private equity funds invest in a diverse set of industries and sectors of the United States economy, including manufacturing, health care, information technology, business services, energy, and others;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas private equity investment drives economic growth throughout the Nation and helps United States businesses compete globally;</text>
