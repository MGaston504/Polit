<whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic attacks have been increasingly directed at places of ordinary daily life and places of worship, including—</text> <paragraph id="H4DBD24E072AA48DFB92E0DB2017ECCFB"><enum>(1)</enum><text>the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham (ISIS) and attacked a kosher supermarket in Paris, France, January 9, 2015, murdering four Jewish patrons; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HEFE761A1E18B420D8FF178B8BC23BE5E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>the violent extremist who pledged his loyalty to ISIS and attacked the Great Synagogue in Copenhagen, Denmark, during a bat mitzvah celebration, February 15, 2015, murdering a member of the Jewish community on security duty, and wounding two members of the Danish Police Service; </text></paragraph></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas anti-Semitic attacks are threats to the fundamental freedoms, rights, security, and diversity of all citizens, societies, and countries in which they occur;</text></whereas>
<whereas><text>Whereas governments have primary responsibility for the security and safety of all of their citizens and therefore primary responsibility for monitoring, preventing, and responding to anti-Semitic violence;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas Jewish community groups that focus on strengthening safety awareness, crisis management, and preparedness are essential to keeping members of the Jewish community safe, and complement efforts of government and inter-governmental entities;</text></whereas>

<whereas><text>Whereas relevant information, research, and analysis is vital to strengthening the preparedness, prevention, mitigation, and response of Jewish communities and law enforcement agencies;</text></whereas> <whereas><text>Whereas broader efforts to counter violent extremism, and efforts to counter anti-Semitism, should be integrated with each other as appropriate and share best practices;</text></whereas>
