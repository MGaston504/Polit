 <whereas><text>Whereas American small businesses face major obstacles complying with their Federal tax obligations;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the complexity of the Federal tax code unfairly penalizes small businesses;</text> </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas such complexity requires small business owners to spend significant amounts of time, money, and resources complying with their tax obligations and less time operating their business;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas Congress has exacerbated these challenges for America’s small businesses by failing to update the tax code in a manner that properly reflects current circumstances;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas tax policy should also promote increased savings by American citizens to be able to afford the costs of living deeper into old age;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas employee stock ownership plans help small businesses offer economic incentives to employees and help employees save more for their retirements via investments in their employing companies;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas tax policy should support small businesses in providing benefit packages to their employees to be competitive with larger employers for the best talent;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the successful research and development tax credit has been used to incentivize private firms to invest in research and development, and private investment leads to spillover effects that can have a broad public good through the creation of new products, the development of new processes, and the launching of new industries;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas while the research and development tax credit is essential for our innovators, it is not accessible to many small businesses and startups—per the Government Accountability Office, over half of the credit goes to firms with $1,000,000,000 or more in receipts;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, according to the Congressional Research Service, numerous commercially successful innovations originated in small, fledgling firms that could not access the research and development credit;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas, if Congress made the research and development tax credit more available to small businesses and startups, thousands of innovative small firms could claim the credit, boosting their capacity to invest in innovation and job creation; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas prudent changes to the structure of the Federal tax code would ease the burden of tax compliance, allowing small businesses to put more money back into their business, community, and the economy: Now, therefore, be it</text>
