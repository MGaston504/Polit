 </section><section id="id60894195AA554F2B834749830AE90AC8"><enum>2.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress makes the following findings:</text>
 <paragraph id="id62d2596d84424737a5a2ec04a84a99ec"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Nearly one-half of the world’s population cooks their food over open fires or inefficient, polluting, and unsafe cookstoves using wood, agricultural waste, dung, coal, or other solid fuels. Smoke from the use of these traditional cookstoves and open fires is associated with a number of chronic and acute diseases and injuries, including respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, heart disease, and cancer, with women and young children affected disproportionately.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idcb2406bac67c44f88524d1b09d7df3a2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Global Burden of Disease Study 2010 (referred to in this paragraph as the <quote>Study</quote>) doubled the mortality estimates for exposure to smoke from cookstoves, referred to as <term>household air pollution</term>, from 2,000,000 to 4,000,000 deaths annually, which the Study indicates is more than the deaths from malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS combined. The Study attributes 3,500,000 deaths to cookstoves smoke exposures indoors and 500,000 deaths to the contribution of cookstoves to outdoor air pollution. Millions more are sickened from the toxic smoke and thousands suffer burns annually from open fires or unsafe cookstoves and fuels. More recently, the World Health Organization found that this type of household air pollution claimed 4,300,000 lives in 2012. The Study ranks household air pollution as the fourth worst overall health risk factor in the world and as the second worst health risk factor in the world for women and girls. Cookstove smoke exposures are particularly prominent in developing regions of Asia and Africa.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id7e9ae64a28ed49eeac31f06d9d80cd5d"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The amount of biomass cooking fuel required each year can reach up to 2 tons per family. Where demand for local biomass outstrips the natural regrowth of resources, local environmental degradation and loss of biodiversity often result.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id77982442552f4eb799c50c87c5da35f3"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Tremendous amounts of time, a burden shouldered disproportionately by women and children, is spent collecting and managing cooking fuel resources. As nearby fuel supplies dwindle, women are forced to go farther to find fuel to cook their families’ meals. In some areas, such as conflict zones or refugee camps, women and girls risk rape and gender-based violence during the up to 20 hours per week they spend away from their communities gathering firewood.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id4f6bd815162941e2b19471dd1131e8e3"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Recent studies show that black carbon created from traditional cookstoves significantly contributes to regional air pollution and climate change. Black carbon emissions from residential cookstoves in developing countries account for an estimated 21 percent of the total global inventory, and mitigation in this sector represents a large potential public health and environmental benefit.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id6b6d654898e64f8fabc43520edc5644f"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves is an innovative public-private partnership hosted by the United Nations Foundation that was created to enable the adoption of clean and efficient stoves in 100,000,000 homes by 2020. The Alliance works with public, private, and non-profit partners to overcome market barriers that currently impede the production, deployment, and use of clean cookstoves and fuels in the developing world.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ide453f83e07d7417ab9ebc8de26ecdc2d"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The United States Government has invested more than $114,000,000 to the sector, including approximately $76,000,000 in research, $31,000,000 in field implementation activities, and $7,000,000 in financing, through the first 5 years of the Alliance to help spur the adoption of clean cookstoves and fuels in 100,000,000 households by 2020. For the second 5 years of the Alliance, beginning with fiscal year 2016, the United States Government anticipates support of up to $175,000,000 to the sector as follows:</text>
