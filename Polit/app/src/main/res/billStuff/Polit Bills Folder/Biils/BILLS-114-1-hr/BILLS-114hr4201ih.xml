 <paragraph id="H891F829133E54A1198FCB3003BB7A9B9"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the 8th Amendment to require governmental entities to provide medical care to persons involuntarily confined in jails, detention centers, and prisons.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H97A545C691584609AD24E030BA54B35F"><enum>(2)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The Federal Government does not provide health benefits under Medicare, Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) to inmates even if the person is awaiting trial in jail and has not been convicted. However, beneficiaries who are released after posting bond, or who are released under their own recognizance, or who are released under house arrest may continue to receive Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, and CHIP benefits.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7431DEFCDD144B4388663E2386BC3CD1"><enum>(3)</enum><text>The cost of providing health care in prisons and jails has increased exponentially due in part to high incarceration rates, infectious diseases, chronic conditions, substance abuse treatment, mental illness, aging prison populations, rising prescription drug costs, and mandatory sentencing laws.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H71FC81F3937C43E58ED9122F17A00F67"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Providing health care for inmates constitutes a major portion of local jail operating costs. Requiring county governments to cover health care costs for inmates who have not been convicted places an unnecessary burden on local governments who have been negatively impacted by recession, widespread budget deficits, and cuts to safety net programs and services.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HB85A3CA482DF4C95979E537FD9B99839"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Jails generally have a higher instance of mentally ill inmates because jails frequently serve as holding places for low-income persons who are waiting placement in a mental facility and for mentally ill persons who commit nuisance crimes because of inadequate access to treatment in their communities.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H35C6B48271EB4CDB99521E3C28F156D2"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The rising cost of bail has also contributed to an overall increase in the jail population and health care costs for inmates. The high cost of bail has contributed to the disproportionate rate of incarceration among African-Americans and Latinos.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDF031F77B19B42A69B8034406204B50C"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Terminating benefits to people in county jails who are awaiting trial violates the presumption of innocence, because it does not distinguish between persons awaiting disposition of charges and those who have been duly convicted and sentenced.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC013032C2FB3442980AF3FD2704E0F67"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Otherwise eligible individuals who have been charged with a crime and incarcerated, but not convicted, should continue to be eligible for Federal health benefits, such as Medicare, Medicaid, SSI, or CHIP, until such time as they may be convicted and sentenced to an institution. SSI payments should be held until the inmate has been acquitted and released, or until the inmate has completed his or her sentence and been released.</text>
