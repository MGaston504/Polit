<paragraph id="H3C68100B757C45EAB28A537A4FB6F8BD"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Responsible father registries, also known as possible father registries or putative father registries, exist in as many as 34 States.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9AAF573F1C6F45908735625CAFE2BA5E"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The Supreme Court of the United States in Lehr v. Robertson (463 U.S. 248) (1983), found responsible father registries to be constitutional.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H76A6D808A1F64FB7A5379D61DC1E6C4D"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Responsible father registries help to speed up the stable placement of children by providing a mechanism to determine whether there are any possible fathers who may have an interest in participating in the placement decisions of the child so that the possible father can timely assert his rights or so that the father’s rights can be waived, surrendered, or terminated and the child made available for adoption or placement.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H75E711457DC74E8AB854760A9CDBB87A"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Responsible father registries protect the privacy and safety of unwed mothers by removing the burden from the mother to provide information about any possible fathers, disclosure of which would be an invasion of her privacy and may cause harm to the mother, particularly in the case of rape or domestic violence.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HAF908D6E2F29457FAB0E3F4B95F1D519"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Responsible father registries serve to protect the rights of men who wish to be involved in the placement decisions of a child they believe they may have fathered by creating a mechanism for such men to undertake responsibility and to protect their rights without having to rely upon others to protect their rights, and to indicate their desire to be notified in a timely manner of certain legal proceedings related to the child, including proceedings related to termination of rights, adoption, and the placement of the child into State custody.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H1037E7E2285D4FD39F8D8B44DAE411FE"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Responsible father registries protect the privacy of possible fathers by providing a mechanism for men to submit identifying information to a database with restricted access.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="H397FB39ECAD84D5592A2BEB116CA6F84"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Responsible father registries protect the interests of adoptive parents and increase the security of adoptions by reducing the risk that possible fathers cannot be located in a timely manner. One of the biggest risks to the finalization of an adoption is the inability of the parties to an adoption proceeding to timely locate the possible fathers. When possible fathers are not provided with timely notice of an adoption proceeding related to a child they may have fathered and discover such proceeding later, the adoption proceeding often is delayed or disrupted. In addition to causing emotional stress and significant costs associated with this problem, such cases, particularly when they attract media attention, create a chilling effect on adoption in that prospective adoptive parents may decide not to pursue the option of adoption for fear that they will be involved in such a case.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H4E4FF15513F24229A29B8B5565F61E7A"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Interstate travel of mothers and the filing of legal actions relating to a child in a State other than the State in which a possible father may have registered may circumvent and eliminate the protections such unwed mothers and possible fathers are provided by the individual State Responsible Father Registries, because there are no agreements or mechanisms between the States to identify or to provide notice to possible fathers who have registered in another State.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE21B054C5A124F4D81D0477401BE6856"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The inability of States to coordinate and cross-check their responsible father registries may jeopardize or delay the placement of the child in a permanent home and undermines the benefits to unwed mothers, protections intended for registered possible fathers, and security for adoptive parents that State registries are intended to afford.</text></paragraph></subsection> <subsection id="HCF33AC6B3B7C4B5A933B5DA2B469CA79"><enum>(b)</enum><header>Purposes</header><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The purposes of this Act are—</text> 
<paragraph id="H5D3D64927E454BA28CE05BE54AF7FA14"><enum>(1)</enum><text>to provide for a national database that would accept possible father registrations from participating State Responsible Father Registries and directly from possible fathers, and would transmit the results of specific searches of such registrations to authorized parties involved in any State’s proceedings, whether the State participates in the national registry or not, for adoption, the placement of a child in State custody, or the termination of a father’s rights;</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HCA0273596F1041D486B0E4A6862FEDAA"><enum>(2)</enum><text>to enable children to find a permanent home more quickly by providing identifying information on possible fathers thereby enabling the fathers’ rights to be addressed in a more timely manner;</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HE76CF7CE3B36462C8853EF382FF2B90D"><enum>(3)</enum><text>to remove the burden from the mother of having to identify potential fathers, to protect her privacy and safety, especially in cases of rape or domestic violence;</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9AFEA87647554BF2A20DCB671E7AAAEB"><enum>(4)</enum><text>to empower men to take responsibility for the protection of their rights by enabling them to register in a participating State or directly with the national registry, increasing the likelihood of men receiving notice of a proceeding in another State and reducing the opportunity for the mother to deprive a possible father of the ability to assert his rights by withholding accurate information concerning the possible father, by moving, or by traveling to another State; and</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HED941CA3CE4544E8AD2095A8B3DC28C6"><enum>(5)</enum><text>to reduce the risk to prospective adoptive parents of delayed or disrupted placements resulting from challenges to adoptions due to a possible father’s untimely receipt of notice of such proceedings.</text></paragraph></subsection></section> <section id="HCAF740FE6B554848BA4A7FF6657F0914"><enum>3.</enum><header>Registries to facilitate adoptions</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Part B of title IV of the <act-name parsable-cite="SSA">Social Security Act</act-name> (<external-xref legal-doc="usc" parsable-cite="usc/42/620">42 U.S.C. 620 et seq.</external-xref>) is amended by adding at the end the following:</text>
