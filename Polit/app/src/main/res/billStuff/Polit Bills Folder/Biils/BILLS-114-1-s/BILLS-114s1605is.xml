 </paragraph><paragraph id="id3c151820c5bf49738712570a64f30653"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Unfortunately, many countries and their economies are isolated and will require greater support to benefit from regional integration of markets, infrastructure, and trade promotion-type policies.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idc0ce37b741d84ec7810c92a0e6245718"><enum>(3)</enum><text>By connecting isolated economies around the world, there exists the potential to increase investment opportunities and support market-based growth.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id56f28f48b9ee49fca238c03b579e67df"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Developing countries, international organizations, and regional economic bodies have increasingly realized that key drivers to economic growth must involve greater cross-border collaboration and regional economic integration.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="ide1a44611de4e4ae7a898b6858309e1bd"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) plays a unique role in economic development throughout the world and pursues its mission of reducing poverty through economic growth by making time-bound grant investments through data selectivity, country ownership, and a focus on results.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idebb9388ab66344abb1f33152b2d1cf74"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The MCC’s compacts have increased access to reliable power, built highway corridors, and improved business climates, thereby promoting economic growth and cross-border engagement within MCC partner countries.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idcd2ce20292cd43f09c7cb365246ce960"><enum>(7)</enum><text>The MCC’s extensive analysis has concluded that a regional approach to poverty reduction, under the right circumstances, can present opportunities to take advantage of higher rates of return on investment and larger scale reductions in poverty.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id025e9f7fe99d475fb413a0854db221d7"><enum>(8)</enum><text>This increased flexibility would promote economic growth and cross-border engagement between and among countries, creating larger and more compatible markets and enabling the United States private sector to compete more effectively and partner with the host-country private sectors.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id0802fcb348b04a228c7695151a1bd15f"><enum>(9)</enum><text>The MCC is developing new partnerships in Asia, including implementation of current compacts in Indonesia and the Philippines, new compacts for Mongolia and the Philippines, and MCC’s first-ever compact engagement in South Asia.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="id5496218ed0cf45cb9d9ebd3dfa81cd34"><enum>(12)</enum><text>To make a coordinated regional investment across several countries work, the Board of Directors of the MCC would need to select a block of countries at the same time to coordinate project development and compact signings, which is unrealistic, or be able to enter into a concurrent compact with one of those countries, for which it currently lacks authority.</text>
