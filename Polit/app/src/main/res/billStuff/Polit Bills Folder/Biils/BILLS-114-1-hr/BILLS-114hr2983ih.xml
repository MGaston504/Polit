<paragraph id="H88BBA5B2AD2245B595BE177DF2CCF684"><enum>(2)</enum><text>That there is a long and robust legal precedent of Federal deference to State primacy in water law and the legal system that States establish for resolving disputes over water use, with the Supreme Court finding in Kansas v. Colorado that <quote>Congress cannot enforce either rule upon any state</quote> in matters of the right regulation of water rights.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="H9FAC88FAEC7C491C8F449EC2ED51AB2B"><enum>(3)</enum><text>That, as established in the Proclamation of a State of Emergency issued by the Governor of the State of California on January 17, 2014, California is experiencing record dry conditions, all regions of the State are impacted by the drought, and these extremely dry conditions have persisted since 2012 and are likely to persist beyond this year and more regularly into the future.</text></paragraph> 
<paragraph id="HD208ACC9748047B1AD4DD438102BF173"><enum>(4)</enum><text>That the State of California is not alone in the prospects for long-term drought, and that the entire American West and Southwest are facing forecasts of prolonged droughts that will leave States facing major water shortages and catastrophic wildfires.</text></paragraph> <paragraph id="HC4F45D0A99E94AB2A06786A7CF77A5EE"><enum>(5)</enum><text>That the prolonged period of drought in the American West has also occurred with higher temperatures throughout the State of California, reducing snowpack and leading to what climate scientists conclude may be the most severe drought in over 1,200 years.</text></paragraph>
