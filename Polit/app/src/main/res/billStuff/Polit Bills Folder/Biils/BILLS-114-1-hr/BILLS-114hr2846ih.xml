 <paragraph id="HD6D36E357EFB4AAA83FC8AEDC98C1476"><enum>(1)</enum><text>Individuals with cancer often do not have access to a cancer care system that incorporates shared decision-making and the coordination of all elements of care.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H82613941B11C4F56A8E19561B5C9E9E2"><enum>(2)</enum><text>The cancer care system has not traditionally offered individuals with cancer a shared decision-making process, a prospective and comprehensive plan for treatment, symptom management and supportive care, strategies for updating and evaluating such plan with the assistance of a health care professional, and a follow-up plan for monitoring and treating possible late effects of cancer and its treatment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFFB16C26BF6D420FB23F8C4E49B8492F"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Cancer survivors often experience the under-diagnosis and under-treatment of the symptoms of cancer, a problem that begins at the time of diagnosis and may become more severe with disease progression and at the end of life. The failure to treat the symptoms, side effects, and late effects of cancer and cancer treatment may have a serious adverse impact on the health, survival, well-being, and quality of life of cancer survivors.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC9A352B3E663420B956AF9340F115C30"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Individuals with cancer often do not participate in a shared decision-making process that considers all treatment options and do not benefit from coordination of all elements of active treatment and palliative care.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H9CA42204809A48A6BBE9F9C7536AA836"><enum>(6)</enum><text>Quality cancer care should incorporate access to psychosocial services and management of the symptoms of cancer and the symptoms of cancer treatment, including pain, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and depression.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H7E3C394B7BD14941AC8193DFDD41981D"><enum>(7)</enum><text>Quality cancer care should include a means for engaging cancer survivors in a shared decision-making process that produces a comprehensive care summary and a plan for follow-up care after primary treatment to ensure that cancer survivors have access to follow-up monitoring and treatment of possible late effects of cancer and cancer treatment, including appropriate psychosocial services.</text>

 </subparagraph></paragraph><paragraph id="H8A40FD44A98B4881BB4E98827E8BB880"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In its report <term>From Cancer Patient to Cancer Survivor: Lost in Transition</term>, the Institute of Medicine recommended that individuals with cancer completing primary treatment be provided a comprehensive summary of their care along with a follow-up survivorship plan of treatment.</text>
