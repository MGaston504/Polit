 </paragraph><paragraph id="H347EC80AF7A643C491A06FE986F105E8"><enum>(4)</enum><text>Water and wastewater infrastructure is comprised of a mixture of old and new technology. In many local communities across the Nation, the old infrastructure has deteriorated to critical conditions and is very costly to replace. Recent government studies have estimated costs of $500,000,000,000 to $800,000,000,000 over the next 20 years for maintaining and improving the existing inventory, building new infrastructure, and meeting new water quality standards.</text>

 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8556335DABC943FCB7CC00ED685D42AB"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Federal partnership with State and local communities has played a pivotal role in improving the Nation’s water quality and drinking water supplies. Federal assistance under this partnership has been the linchpin of these improvements.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H39D274E3BF6D4D77B69C0781C3A720C2"><enum>(7)</enum><text>In light of constrained Federal budgets, the availability of exempt-facility financing represents an important financing tool to help close the gap between funds currently being invested and water infrastructure needs, preserving the Federal partnership.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCE2BD39D1ED140A1A572E3A214AA5406"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Providing alternative financing solutions, such as tax-exempt securities, encourages investment in water and wastewater infrastructure that in turn creates local jobs and protects the health of our citizens.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8ED4BD5E468E4AEDB1D3717D19E694BA"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Federally mandated State volume cap restrictions in conjunction with other priorities have limited the use of tax-exempt securities on water and wastewater infrastructure investment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H5E95490A855E47119C33A427179E3174"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Removal of State volume caps for water and wastewater infrastructure will accelerate and increase overall investment in the Nation’s critical water infrastructure; facilitate increased use of innovative infrastructure delivery methods supporting sustainable water systems through public-private partnerships that optimize design, financing, construction, and long-term management, maintenance and viability; and provide for more effective risk management of complex water infrastructure projects by municipal utility and private sector partners.</text>
