 </paragraph><paragraph id="idd915605bfeeb49419220659e11b44bc7"><enum>(2)</enum><text>Lyme disease is caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, which belongs to the class of spirochaetes, and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected ticks. Early signs of infection may include a rash and flu-like symptoms, such as fever, muscle aches, headaches, and fatigue.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idf2302eb7f0ed49e6a01d5f21a4f60369"><enum>(3)</enum><text>Although Lyme disease can be treated with antibiotics if caught early, the disease often goes undetected because it mimics other illnesses or may be misdiagnosed. Untreated, Lyme disease can lead to severe heart, neurological, and joint problems because the bacteria can affect many different organs and organ systems.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id026d84aac41740a3873c12972a508b79"><enum>(4)</enum><text>If an individual with Lyme disease does not receive treatment, such individual can develop severe heart, neurological, and joint problems.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id7c3a6befbdd048ac90b006e6af92baf5"><enum>(5)</enum><text>Although Lyme disease accounts for 90 percent of all vector-borne disease in the United States, the ticks that spread Lyme disease also spread other diseases, such as anaplasmosis and babesiosis, and carry other strains of Borrelia burgdorferi. Other tick species, such as the aggressive lone star tick, spread ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and southern tick-associated rash illness (STARI). Multiple diseases in 1 patient make diagnosis and treatment more difficult.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idef3462f06e804c28aba8b8e4f085dbf0"><enum>(6)</enum><text>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported over 36,000 confirmed or probable Lyme disease cases in 2013 and has estimated that the total number of people diagnosed with Lyme disease annually is roughly 10 times higher than the number of cases reported.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idbd4b8af75dd9480d8cae40738418cd59"><enum>(7)</enum><text>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, from 1992 to 2006, the incidence of Lyme disease was highest among children 5 to 14 years of age.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="id0360ea52e47247dcb10471a9430721b6"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Persistence of symptomatology in many patients without reliable testing makes diagnosis and treatment of patients more difficult.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="idF224AF0BE6A64DC1B014EAF845206509"><enum>(9)</enum><text>In the absence of a safe and effective human vaccine, reducing exposure to ticks is the best defense against Lyme disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and other tick-borne diseases. Entomology-based approaches to prevent tick-borne diseases include the use and development of insect repellent, prompt tick removal, application of pesticides, and reduction of tick habitat.</text>
