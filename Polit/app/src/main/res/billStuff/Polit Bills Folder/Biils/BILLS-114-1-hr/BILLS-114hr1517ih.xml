The International Agency for Research on Cancer has classified formaldehyde in the riskiest category, saying it causes cancer in humans.</text>

Overall, that exposure to nicotine during fetal development has lasting adverse consequences for brain development. Moreover, evidence suggests that nicotine exposure during adolescence may also have lasting consequences on the developing brain.</text>

Therefore, electronic cigarettes do not only produce <quote>water vapor</quote> as is claimed in the marketing of these products. Furthermore, the particle size distribution and number of particles delivered by electronic cigarettes are similar to those contained in conventional cigarettes. There is already strong evidence that frequent low or short-term levels of exposure to these types of particles from tobacco smoke or air pollution can contribute to health problems such as the increased risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and death.</text>
