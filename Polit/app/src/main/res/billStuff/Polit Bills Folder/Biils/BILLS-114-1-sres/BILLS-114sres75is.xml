 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, almost 20 percent of teenage girls who were exposed to physical dating violence did not attend school on 1 or more occasions during the 30 days preceding the survey because the girls felt unsafe at school or on the way to or from school;</text>

 </paragraph></whereas><whereas><text>Whereas a study published in Pediatrics suggests that teen dating violence <quote>is a substantial public health problem</quote> because victims of teen dating violence are—</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas according to the 2009 Parent/Teen Dating Violence Poll by Liz Claiborne Inc., although 82 percent of parents are confident that they could recognize the signs if their child was experiencing dating abuse, 58 percent of parents could not correctly identify all of the warning signs of abuse;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas 74 percent of teenage boys and 66 percent of teenage girls report that they have not had a conversation with a parent about dating abuse in the past year;</text>

 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the severity of violence among intimate partners has been shown to be greater in cases where a pattern of violence was established during adolescence;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas primary prevention programs are a key part of addressing teen dating violence, and successful examples of these programs include education, community outreach, and social marketing campaigns that are culturally appropriate;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas educating middle school students and the parents of middle school students about the importance of building healthy relationships and preventing teen dating violence is key to deterring dating abuse before it begins;</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas skilled assessment and intervention programs are necessary for young victims and abusers; and</text>
 </whereas><whereas><text>Whereas the establishment of the month of February 2015, as National Teen Dating Violence Awareness and Prevention Month will benefit schools, communities, and families regardless of socioeconomic status, race, or sex: Now, therefore, be it</text>
