 </section><section id="H725DF797544F4D19B836FF23BC9001A8"><enum>4.</enum><header>Findings</header><text display-inline="no-display-inline">Congress finds the following:</text> <paragraph id="H11C2516C082942268A8050C9D801E3EE"><enum>(1)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified 17 neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). Approximately two billion people—almost one-third of the world’s population—are at risk of contracting an NTD, and more than 1.4 billion people are currently afflicted with one or more NTDs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H84166C9DFFC54081992636C58984E562"><enum>(2)</enum><text>In 2013, WHO adopted a comprehensive resolution on NTDs recognizing that increased national and international investments in prevention and control of neglected tropical diseases have succeeded in improving health and social well-being in many countries.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFAC1FC0DD91D4110A106E397DDA33D1D"><enum>(3)</enum><text>NTDs have an enormous impact in terms of disease burden and quality of life. NTDs cause the loss of up to 534,000 lives and 57 million disability-adjusted life years each year. NTDs surpass both malaria and tuberculosis in causing greater loss of life-years to disability and premature death. Many NTDs cause disfigurement and disability, leading to stigma, social discrimination, and societal marginalization.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HDEADCBD47EB044728049BB5F042DBF83"><enum>(4)</enum><text>NTDs create an economic burden of billions of dollars through the loss of productivity and high costs of health care required for treatment. People afflicted by NTDs are less productive than their healthy counterparts. NTDs jeopardize the ability of people to attend work and school, or to produce at full capacity. For example, controlling one NTD, hookworm, in children can result in a 43-percent increase in future wage earnings.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD078F803EEA44E559CDCB61D89960BB1"><enum>(5)</enum><text>The social, economic, and health burden of NTDs falls primarily on low- and middle-income countries, where access to safe water, sanitation, and health care is limited. At least 100 countries face two endemic NTD burdens, and 30 countries carry six or more endemic NTDs.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA88DC0DA066641C1937C36E3ABE87E62"><enum>(6)</enum><text>NTDs are not confined to the developing world, however. Several NTD outbreaks have been reported in the United States and other developed countries, especially among the poor. In the United States, NTDs disproportionately affect people living in poverty, and especially minorities, including up to 2.8 million African-Americans with toxocariasis and 300,000 or more people, mostly Hispanic-Americans, with Chagas disease.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFD7F58D8A84349F5B43BE88C9DDE16AF"><enum>(7)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">In 2014, an outbreak of Ebola Virus Diseases (Ebola) caused a pandemic that infected more than 20,000 people, including more than 8,000 deaths. Although not listed as an NTD by the World Health Organization, Ebola shares the same characteristics as other NTDs by affecting people living <quote>under conditions of poverty</quote> and is <quote>concentrated almost exclusively in impoverished populations in the developing world</quote>. Even when the disease had spread to the United States and other developed countries, it was contained and controlled by the well-equipped health systems in those areas.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H8734010CE9B741C9B1B21F2130E64459"><enum>(8)</enum><text>Many NTDs can be controlled, prevented, and even eliminated using low-cost, effective, and feasible solutions. Understanding the economic burden of NTDs on productivity and health care costs can help to assure governments and donors that the resources directed toward NTDs represent a good investment.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HCA9DD383DEA6439CB929C51FC9B67646"><enum>(9)</enum><text>Research and development efforts are immediately needed for all NTDs, especially those for which limited or no treatment currently exists.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HFD75524A5959423A9EA31DD079FB104D"><enum>(10)</enum><text>Critical to developing robust NTD control strategies are epidemiological data that identify at-risk populations, ensure appropriate treatment frequency, and inform decisions about when treatment can be reduced or stopped.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HC89409D04B9D46D8B2721055F91DF4C0"><enum>(11)</enum><text>Of the 14 most common NTDs, roughly 80 percent of infections are caused by soil-transmitted helminths (STH) and schistosomiasis. STH are a group of three parasitic worms (roundworms, whipworms, and hookworms) that afflict more than one billion people worldwide, including 600 million school-age children, of whom more than 300 million suffer from severe morbidity. Schistosomiasis is another helminth infection affecting at least 200 million people in developing countries, but some estimates indicate that the true number of people affected may be double or even triple that number.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HD134F52090F247DEB415DE943AE1E1C3"><enum>(12)</enum><text>The main health problems caused by STH are related to their negative effect on childhood nutritional status, which can cause stunting and wasting. For example, STH infection may lead to anemia, malabsorption of nutrients, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and reduced food intake. When such health problems are experienced in early childhood, a peak growth and development period, the mental and physical damage—and loss of future productivity and wage-earning potential—will likely be irreversible. Schistosomiasis causes end-organ damage to the urinary tract, female genital tract, liver and intestines. It also results in chronic health conditions in children.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="HA2E8AC57A0074B979212AD3A7C4F925C"><enum>(13)</enum><text>STH and schistosomiasis are also particularly detrimental to the health of women of reproductive age and pregnant women. Their underlying poor iron status makes these women most susceptible to developing anemia. Iron deficiency anemia resulting from hookworm infection during pregnancy has been linked to poor pregnancy outcomes such as prematurity, low birth weight, and impaired lactation. Female genital schistosmiasis may be one of the most common gynecologic conditions in Africa leading to genital pain, itching, and bleeding and markedly increased susceptibility to HIV/AIDS.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H75B91F7ABCEC427FAEC3B60C33B583A2"><enum>(14)</enum><text>Fortunately, there is a simple, cost-effective solution to STH and schistosomiasis infections: single-dose deworming pills that can be safely administered once or twice annually to those at risk. Pharmaceutical companies have committed to donate the drugs needed to treat all at-risk, school-age children in developing countries. Regular administration of deworming pills reduces morbidity associated with STH and schistosomiasis infections by reducing prevalence and transmission rates.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H63F1121CE78D478ABC3B33833E41A634"><enum>(15)</enum><text display-inline="yes-display-inline">Improved access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) can also reduce the transmission of NTDs, particularly intestinal worms.</text>
 </paragraph><paragraph id="H881081D0A30343F1B85173A9B7F6EB6A"><enum>(16)</enum><text>The benefits of deworming are immediate and enduring. A rigorous randomized controlled trial has shown school-based deworming treatment to reduce school absenteeism by 25 percent. School-based deworming also benefits young siblings and other children who live nearby but are too young to be treated, leading to large cognitive improvements equivalent to half a year of schooling.</text>
